<p><span class="smcap">This</span> volume of selected reports of the most remarkable
trials for murder by poisoning, which have been held
during the past half century, with essays and notes
explanatory of the nature, and operation, and methods of
detecting the various poisons supposed to have been employed,
will it is hoped prove useful to the medical, as well
as the legal profession. With this object the evidence of
the medical and chemical witnesses has been given in
detail, especially in those cases in which a conflict of
scientific testimony arose, between experts of the highest
professional character and reputation. Care has also been
taken to state the scientific nomenclature of this class of
witness correctly, a point on which the shorthand writers,
otherwise so reliable, are naturally liable to fail, catching as
they do only the sounds of a language unknown to them,
in reporting which the error even in a single letter is often
most important. My colleague, besides furnishing the
latest information obtainable with reference to the various
poisons, has offered from recent experiments, made specially
for this purpose, explanations of those points in the several
trials about which the rival experts disputed, bringing to
bear on them the latest discoveries in chemical science.</p>

<p>In preparing these reports, I have followed the form
adopted by the late Mr. Townsend, the Recorder of Macclesfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
in his valuable volumes of trials&mdash;now I believe quite
out of print&mdash;grouping the witnesses under the heads of
the case to which their evidence specially applied, dividing
the scientific from the moral testimony, and wherever a
conflict arose between the experts called for the prosecution
and those for the defence, giving the evidence of the latter
immediately after that of the former, so as to place the
points at issue more clearly before the reader.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible, within reasonable limits,
to have reported in detail the elaborate speeches of counsel
(most of them models of argument, criticism, and eloquence),
or the minute and exhaustive charges of many of the presiding
judges. The abstracts which have been given will,
however, serve to perpetuate the most important and notable
parts of both. In some of the cases the immediate application
of these either to certain points in the evidence, or
to the arguments adduced on either side, has been shown
by quotations in the notes. With these exceptions, and
a few notes pointing out errors or discrepancies in the
evidence, I have generally forborne to express an opinion
on the verdict, preferring to present such reports of the
evidence as may enable the student to form his own
conclusions.</p>

<p>With the progress of chemical science the field of the
poisoner is constantly extending. New poisons are yearly
discovered, each succeeding one apparently more difficult
of detection than the former. Death lurks in many unsuspected
forms, and but for the parallel march of the science
of detection, the poisoner would more often escape. A
grave danger to society, too, lies in the patent medicines,
so popular and so perilous; in the vermin killers, loaded
with deadly poison, which can be bought without let or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
hindrance by any one; and the use of preparations for
animals&mdash;not so deleterious to the latter, as they are death-dealing&mdash;if
either intentionally or by accident given to a
human being. Stringent as the regulations of the Poisons
Act appear on paper, the facility with which Lamson purchased
aconitia, merely on the credit of his name appearing
in the Medical Directory, and the really unrestricted sale
of patent medicines and vermin-killers, mark the practical
inutility of the Act. A new Act, dealing with these points,
has been promised by the Government, but there seems
little probability of its passing this session.</p>

<p class="pr2 p1">G. L. B.</p>

<hr class="d1" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the compilation of these chemical notes it has been
found very difficult to be sufficiently simple and complete
in explanation for non-scientific readers, without either
sacrificing many important details, or exceeding the limited
space available. I have attempted as far as possible not
only to solve the questions that arose in the trials, but to
look forward to many that might occur in future cases. No
claim is laid to originality except in a few experiments;
but the search through existing authorities has involved so
much labour, that I must plead a very limited leisure as an
excuse for any incompleteness. In such portions as touched
on medicine I have been guided by the later text-books, and
by living advice. It has been thought preferable to give
references in the text, at the very passage quoted, instead
of in foot-notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the proposed new Poisons Act one or two
considerations should not be forgotten. There are hundreds
of ways of taking life: the poisoner’s is only one. Even in
his method the number of fatal agents he may use is almost
unlimited. To make a schedule of certain poisons that are
not to be sold without restriction, seems like prohibiting
knives, while allowing stilettos&mdash;the latter are certainly less
usual, but quite as fatal. Moreover, the Act of 1868 only
affects one channel by which poisons may reach the public&mdash;viz.,
through the retail chemists. It secures a record of
ordinary shop purchases, and thus facilitates the tracing of
crime. But the channels of trade are still open: hundred-weights
of arsenic are obtained, where ounces could not be
purchased; and these large stocks are often carelessly kept,
and left open to servants, workmen, or even children. The
result is that the supposed restrictions on obtaining poisons
are almost illusory: these substances are sown broadcast
among ignorant people, and are placed in cupboards
unlabelled among articles of food. The following are recent
illustrations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“At Corkley, Wilts, the wife of a labourer used, instead of
baking-powder, a packet of arsenic, intended by her husband as
medicine for his horses. The husband and wife died.”&mdash;<i>Weekly
Dispatch, May 6, 1883.</i></p>

<p>“At Whitchurch, a farmer was accused of poisoning a large
number of cattle and other animals with arsenic. In 1881 he
had obtained several pounds of it from Liverpool, stating that he
wanted it to destroy vermin.”&mdash;<i>Evening Standard, June 2, 1883.</i></p></div>

<p class="p1">In the schedule of the 1868 Act, among the <i>less dangerous
poisons</i>, to be obtained without restriction beyond
proper labelling, appears, “Almonds, Essential Oil of
(<i>unless deprived of prussic acid</i>).” Yet this preparation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
one of the most perilous, as has been shown by numbers of
deaths, and lately by the West Malling case (not yet ripe
enough for reporting). There are also other faults in the
schedule.</p>

<p>Remembering, then, that legislation on the sale of poisons
is utterly unable to <i>prevent</i> poisoning, that all it can do is
to make the means a little difficult, and the detection more
easy, how can we approve the proposal at this moment
made, to tack on a few, very tentative clauses to an unsuccessful
Act, and four more names to a very defective
schedule? Why insert chloride of antimony, and omit
nitrate of silver, sulphate of copper, and chloride of tin?
The essence of a “poison” is <i>quantity</i>; and no Act which
does not specify the maximum quantity that may be sold,
can be effective. Beyond this, why should it be more
criminal to <i>sell</i> a dangerous substance to a poisoner than to
<i>give</i> it to him, or by culpable negligence to allow him to
take possession of it? If such neglect were made punishable,
if people who left arsenic, &amp;c., about in cupboards
without precaution, had to suffer for the consequences, we
should hear less of such “accidents.”</p>

<p>I am deeply indebted to Dr. Bernays, Professor of Chemistry
at St. Thomas’s Hospital, for kind advice and
facilities of consultation and experiment; to Doctors Harley,
Ord, Acland, and to my namesake, Mr. Charles Stewart,
F.L.S., for many valuable suggestions; and especially to
Mr. E. G. Clayton, F.C.S., who contributed the main part
of the chapter on Aconitia, and helped me materially in
other portions of the chemical notes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> proceeding to a separate examination of the poisons
used in the following trials, it will be advisable to take a
general view of poisons, specially noticing those that we have
selected as the most important legally. They do not admit,
perhaps, of accurate classification, but inasmuch as the manner
of death and symptoms are usually the most available
indication as to the nature of the poison that has acted, the
following arrangement will be serviceable. The heads indicate
the most prominent symptom:</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Sudden Death.</span>&mdash;Large quantities of any poison might
be rapid in fatal result, but the sudden poisons proper are:&mdash;concentrated
sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids; poisonous
gases and vapours, such as carbonic acid and sulphuretted
hydrogen (<i>see</i> Casper’s Forensic Medicine, Case
CCXLI.), carbonic oxide, arseniuretted and antimoniuretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
hydrogen, and certain rare organic compounds, as kakodyl,
&amp;c.; strychnia sometimes, oxalic acid in large doses, chloroform
under certain circumstances. But beyond all others,
the quickest of poisons is <i>hydrocyanic or prussic acid</i>.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Insensibility</span>, generally following nervous excitement.
Morphia and opium; henbane (<i>Hyoscyamus</i>); stramonium;
belladonna; nicotine (<i>tobacco</i>); darnel (<i>lolium temulentum</i>);
hemlock (<i>Conium maculatum</i>); water hemlock (<i>Œnanthe crocata</i>);
fool’s parsley (<i>Æthusa cynapium</i>), [Dr. J. Harley
shows that this is not so poisonous as believed: <i>see</i>
St. Thomas’s Hospital Reports, x. 25]; Indian hemp (<i>Cannabis
indica</i>); Woody Nightshade (<i>Solanum dulcamara</i>);
Solanum nigrum; the berries of Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>);
Lobelia inflata: Foxglove (<i>Digitalis</i>); cocculus indicus; certain
fungi (notably <i>Amanita muscaria</i>); chloroform; chloral; butylchloral
&mdash;“croton chloral”): amylene; methylene dichloride;
sulphuretted hydrogen; carbonic oxide; and many other
substances usually classed as <i>narcotics</i>.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Vomiting.</span>&mdash;Irritant poisons, such as acids, alkalies,
alkaline salts in considerable doses (even common salt has
proved fatal: <i>see</i> Christison<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>); most soluble compounds of
the heavy metals (especially antimony, arsenic, zinc, and
copper); certain vegetal alkaloids (from colchicum, laburnum,
yew, savin, ipecacuanha, capsicum, pepper, ergot, many
species of Ranunculaceæ, the Hellebores, and some fungi);
cantharides, turpentine, and essential oils, &amp;c. Pain in the
digestive organs, purging, and general inflammation are
commonly present. Most of the medicinal purgatives will
produce sickness and vomiting if given in overdoses; of
course unwholesome food or disease may frequently be the
cause.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Action on the Eye.</span>&mdash;Opium and morphia, calabar
bean, aconite (?), and strychnia, <i>contract</i> the pupil: belladonna,
henbane, tobacco, stramonium, digitalis and hemlock,
<i>dilate</i> the pupil. The effect is often temporary, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
is reversed after a time. It is a valuable indication in
after-experiments on animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Convulsions.</span>&mdash;Strychnia, brucia, and some fungi: but
this symptom is by no means confined to these, and may even
result as tetanus, from disease or irritants (<i>see</i> Trial of
Palmer). Morphia, in rare cases, has also caused it.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Chronic Poisoning</span>, prostration and wasting. Antimony,
mercury, and lead in small repeated doses. With the two
latter, but more especially with lead, there is a <i>blue line at the
edge of the gums</i>; constipation and colic, paralysis and trembling
of the limbs. As lead frequently occurs as an impurity
in food, and also may be absorbed by those working with it,
these symptoms may be often accidental. Mercury also is
given, less than of old, it is true, but still systematically by
some, as a regular course in syphilis, &amp;c.: also to children in
teething powders. Antimony has been almost abandoned in
medicine, from its depressant effect. In these cases, motive,
amount, and necessity of dose, and right to administer, must
be considered before wilful poisoning can be proved. The
analysis, therefore, must be strictly <i>quantitative</i>, which is
fortunately tolerably easy.</p>

<p>The above summary is by no means perfect, since there are
minor differences in each class, which may sometimes rise
into such prominence as to confuse the classification. But
in medical evidence on the individual poisons of which we
treat, those physiologically resembling them in action are
always most heard of at the trial, and questions are asked
whether this or that may not produce the same symptoms;
and hence it is well to direct attention to the analogues of our
types.</p>

<p>The primary idea of an <i>alkaloid</i> is derived from its resemblance
to an <i>alkali</i>. Alkaloids are often called also “Organic
Bases.” Their names terminate in&mdash;<i>ia</i> or <i>ine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They are
more or less alkaline to test paper, and combine with acids to
form salts which are neutral in reaction and often crystallizable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Only a few of the alkaloids are liquid and easily volatile,
but almost all can be volatilized by careful heating at
definite temperatures, giving in many cases a sublimate of
characteristic appearance under the microscope, either of crystals,
globules, or a mere film. In a free state, the alkaloids
are very slightly soluble in water, but soluble in alcohol,
and generally in ether and chloroform. Some are soluble in
benzine, others in amylic alcohol, petroleum spirit, acetic
ether, &amp;c. On a judicious use of these various solvents
depend the different processes of isolation, among which Dragendorff’s
is the most complete, but so complicated that it is
rarely used in its entirety. Fortunately there is generally a
clue more or less definite to the probable poison administered,
enabling a shorter and quicker method to be adopted. For
further details as to these processes see Blyth’s Manual of
Practical Chemistry. The sulphates, chlorides, and acetates
of the alkaloids are generally soluble in water; if ammonia or
potash be added to the solution, a precipitate (usually
crystalline) of the free alkaloid occurs if the solution be of
moderate strength.</p>

<p>Chemically, the alkaloids are derived from ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)
by substituting various organic groups or “compound radicles”
(compounds of carbon and hydrogen), for the hydrogen
of the ammonia. They are therefore “compound ammonias,”
or “amines.” Nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen, are always
present in natural alkaloids, the non-volatile ones, including
the greater number, also contain oxygen.</p>

<p>Physiologically, alkaloids as a class have a powerful action
on the human and animal frame. The medicinal properties
of plants are generally due to these substances, though many
are still undiscovered or imperfectly known. They exist in
the plant combined with vegetal acids, some of which are
characteristic, as aconitic acid in aconite, meconic in opium,
igasuric (?) in nux vomica, &amp;c. The very small quantity which
may sometimes be fatal (a fraction of a grain of the pure
alkaloid), the indefiniteness of many of their chemical reactions,
and the facility with which they decompose if too high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a heat, or too strong reagents, be employed in their extraction,
render the detection often a difficult, and sometimes an impossible
matter. Fortunately, however, fresh tests and better
processes develop from every case, and other indications, from
symptoms and collateral circumstances, rarely fail to bring home
the guilt even to the most ingenious and scientific of poisoners.</p>

<p>For extracting the alkaloids from animal matters the following
process has been used by the author. Mince finely,
digest with rectified spirit and enough acetic acid to <i>just
acidify</i>, warm to blood-heat for 15 minutes, filter: this is
the first extract. Warm the insoluble matters with more
alcohol and filter again: this is the second extract. Repeat
the extraction a third time. <i>Keep the three extracts separate.</i>
Each should be evaporated at as low a temperature as possible,
not exceeding 50° C., and preferably in a vacuum at the
ordinary temperature, if this can be done fairly quickly. The
syrupy residues must be treated with water and a drop of
acetic acid, passed through wet filters to separate fat, rendered
just alkaline with ammonia, and shaken with a moderate
quantity of a mixture of equal volumes of ether and chloroform
(Allen). By a stoppered funnel or burette the ethereal
layer is separated, the shaking with ether and chloroform and
the separation repeated a second and a third time, the ethereal
extracts mixed, transferred to a large porcelain dish, and
evaporated, first in a current of air, then in a vacuum or
spontaneously. As the solvents evaporate, water generally
appears: this hinders any crystallization. Therefore the
residue must be rendered <i>dry</i>, then dissolved in a little
<i>anhydrous</i> chloroform (dried by standing over fused calcium
chloride), and again evaporated in air in a large watch glass.
The residue will generally be crystalline under the microscope
if any alkaloid be present. Dissolve again in chloroform,
transfer to a graduated burette, make up to a convenient
volume (say 10 cubic centimetres), and transfer a measured
fraction to a number of watch glasses, reserving about one-fourth
for any subsequent <i>quantitative</i> test that may be necessary.
Allow the liquid in the watch glasses to spontaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
evaporate. To the first add a little water and a very minute
quantity of dilute hydrochloric acid, and cautiously taste a
portion. A tingling of the lips and subsequent numbness
indicate <i>aconite</i>; intense bitterness points to <i>strychnia</i>; if
there be no taste at all it is unlikely that any alkaloid is
present. There are some alkaloids of a peppery taste; these
are irritants, and are not common as poisons. Bitterness is
the most frequent characteristic.</p>

<p>2. Moisten the contents of the second watch glass with a
little water and a trace of acetic acid, and apply through an
incision in the skin of the back of a young frog. He should
be kept as comfortable as possible and the symptoms observed.
Strychnia readily produces tetanus in this animal; other
poisons also have peculiar effects. Some observers have used
mice, rabbits, or cats; in the Palmer trial it was observed that
dogs were not employed because they were inconvenient and
might bite! On the whole this so-called physiological test
has been overrated, as it is hardly to be expected that an
animal with its back cut and otherwise injured will not exhibit
some symptoms; and all who have kept wild animals in confinement
will know how soon they become, first almost convulsive
from excitement, then finally sink into stupor and die.
If necessary, any judge may grant a special licence to the
experts in a trial to make experiments on animals, otherwise
such cruelty is rendered penal by the Vivisection Act.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>3. To the third watch glass, after the contents have been
dissolved as before, a drop of a solution of iodine in potassium
iodide is added. Nearly all alkaloids give a brown precipitate.
If none occur, a negative conclusion may be expected.</p>

<p>4. Test the fourth watch glass in one corner for strychnia
by concentrated sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese; in
another corner for morphia by iodic acid and starch; in a third
corner for brucia (and morphia) by strong nitric acid. (See
the special paragraphs on these reactions, pp. 280, 285.)</p>

<p>5. If there is still no indication, and no information has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
been obtained from other sources, it may be necessary to
employ Dragendorff’s process on the remainder. But if the
poison has been discovered, the solution reserved in the
burette should be evaporated, dissolved in water and a little
dilute acid, avoiding heat, and titrated by Mayer’s reagent to
ascertain the quantity.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The second and third extractions of the organs must now
be considered. Most of the text-books recommend that <i>all
the extracts should be mixed</i>. The objection to this is, that
since the alkaloid is usually present in very small amount,
the first extraction will remove nearly all of it, while the
second and third will mainly contain other matters, and
therefore will be only adding to the impurities, and consequently
to the difficulty of isolation. If it be worth while,
the second and third extracts may be treated <i>separately</i> as
above, and should any further quantity of alkaloid be found,
it may be determined quantitatively, and the amount added
to that already obtained.</p>

<p>It has been proposed to precipitate the original spirituous
extract by neutral or basic acetate of lead, which throws down
many impurities, but leaves the alkaloids in solution. After
filtration, the liquid is treated with a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen to remove lead; again filtered, evaporated (as
speedily as can be done without overheating) to a moderate
bulk, and treated with a little ammonia and with ether-chloroform
as before. If the sulphuretted hydrogen be left
exposed to the air for some time, it oxidizes to sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
acid, which, during and after evaporation, tends to destroy
the alkaloid. Hence I have found it advisable to remove the
H<sub>2</sub>S quickly by a current of carbonic acid and warming&mdash;previous
to evaporation. But this process is not good for
alkaloids, as sulphur compounds are often formed, which
interfere with subsequent operations.</p>

<p>The foregoing process may fail to extract <i>morphia</i>, <i>curarine</i>,
and <i>solanine</i>, as these, being very little soluble in ether-chloroform,
may remain behind in the aqueous liquid. This, therefore,
should be afterwards treated in one of the following ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Heat some redistilled amylic alcohol nearly to boiling
(it boils at 120° C.), add an equal volume to the aqueous
(alkaline) solution; shake vigorously, separate while still hot,
and shake again with a fresh, but rather smaller, quantity of
the hot solvent. The united amylic alcohol solutions will
contain all the morphia, but can only be distilled in vacuo,
since at 120° C. the stability of the morphia would be endangered.
It is better to extract the morphia from the amylic
solution by shaking with successive small portions of weak
acetic acid, separating each time, till the acidity remains unneutralized.
The alkaloid will now be in the acid solution.
Nearly neutralize this with ammonia, evaporate at a gentle
heat, and apply the special tests.</p>

<p>2. Instead of the above, the aqueous alkaline solution may
be agitated with a mixture of equal volumes of ether and
<i>pure</i> acetic ether (the latter having been previously purified
from free acid by standing over powdered carbonate of lime).
Although this mixture does not extract the morphia so
readily as amylic alcohol, it has this advantage that, after
separation from the aqueous layer, it can be evaporated at a
moderate temperature, when the morphia, if in sufficient
quantity, will be left in the crystalline state, and can be
tested as usual.</p>

<p>If sufficient material be at hand, of course both processes
may be used.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Selmi (Gazz. Chim. Ital. vi., 32) has given a process for
alkaloidal extraction of which I have no experience.</p>

<p>When the alkaloid is obtained in a sufficiently pure form
and in sufficient quantity, the sublimation process of Dr. Guy,
as improved by Blyth, may be used. For the entire original
method, see Blyth’s Practical Chemistry, page 285.</p>

<p>Dr. Guy’s “subliming cell” is a ring of glass tubing
about ⅛-inch long and ⅓ to ½-inch diameter, ground true and
smooth at top and bottom, resting on a circle of thin microscope
glass, and covered with another similar circle. The
alkaloid, thoroughly dry, is placed on the lower disc (a drop
of the solution may be evaporated on it), the whole fitted
together, and floated on mercury, or better, fusible metal,
contained in a small glass beaker nearly full, supported on
wire gauze over a small flame. A thermometer held by a
clamp dips in the liquid metal. With a hand lens of as
high power as possible, the melting point, and also the point
when the first sublimate occurs on the upper glass, may be
observed. As soon as the sublimate has become sufficiently
distinct, the upper disc is removed, replaced by another, and
examined under ¼-inch power of the microscope. The heat
is slowly raised till charring occurs, and anything characteristic
noted.</p>

<p><i>Morphia</i> gives a clouding, consisting of minute dots, at
150° C.; from 188° to 200° C., distinct crystals are obtained;
then it commences to brown, melt, and carbonize.</p>

<p><i>Strychnia</i> gives a minute sublimate of fine needles at
169° C., and melts at about 221° C.</p>

<p><i>Brucia</i> melts at 151° C., browns easily, but gives no true
sublimate.</p>

<p><i>Aconitine</i> or aconitia melts at 183° to 184° C.</p>

<p><i>Pseudaconitine</i> melts at 104° to 105° C., and easily
decomposes, giving off water.</p>

<p><i>Commercial aconitine</i> usually melts below 100° C., and
gives an amorphous sublimate above 150° C.</p>

<p>The reactions of the other alkaloids will be found in Blyth’s
Practical Chemistry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to avoid repetition, the mode of preparing the
general reagents for alkaloids will be given here.</p>

<p>1. <i>Mayers Reagent</i>, potassio-iodide of mercury, already
described (p. 7; Liebig’s Annalen, 133, 286), gives white
precipitates with almost all alkaloids. The latter can be
recovered from the precipitate by treating it with a solution
of zinc chloride mixed with caustic soda. (Mayer.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Potassium tri-iodide</i>, a solution of iodine in potassium
iodide, gives a brown or reddish precipitate.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>Sonnenschein’s test</i>, Phosphomolybdic acid, is prepared
as follows. To a warm solution of molybdate of ammonia
acidified with nitric acid, phosphate of soda is added as long
as any yellow precipitate is obtained. The precipitate is
washed with water containing a little nitric acid, and heated
with sodium carbonate solution till dissolved. Evaporate to
dryness, heat to expel ammonia, add a little nitric acid and
heat again. One part of the residue is then dissolved in a
mixture of one part of nitric acid of 1·4 sp. gr., and nine
parts of water. With this reagent <i>strychnia</i> gives a pale,
other <i>alkaloids</i> a bright yellow flocculent precipitate, in very
dilute solutions. The precipitates are soluble in ammonia,
with the production of a greenish blue colour in the cases of
aconitia and morphia. From the alkaline liquid the <i>alkaloid</i>
can be dissolved out by at once shaking with ether-chloroform
or hot amylic alcohol as already described. Instead of using
ammonia, the precipitate may be agitated with barium carbonate,
which has less tendency to decompose the base on its
liberation.</p>

<p>4. A solution of <i>bismuth iodide</i> in iodide of potassium is
recommended by Dragendorff (Zeitschr. f. Chimie, 1866,
478). 80 grammes of commercial bismuth subnitrate are
dissolved in 200 cubic centimetres of nitric acid of sp. gr.
1·18: 272 grammes of potassium iodide dissolved in a little
water are added, the potassium nitrate allowed to crystallize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
out, and the whole diluted to one litre. This solution
precipitates most alkaloids. The precipitate can be treated
with sodium carbonate and the liberated alkaloid extracted by
ether-chloroform, &amp;c. For the equivalents, see Maugini,
Gazz. Chim. Ital. 12, 155.</p>

<p>5. Scheibler has proposed <i>Phosphotungstic acid</i> as a precipitant.
Sodium tungstate is digested with half its weight
of phosphoric acid, sp. gr. 1·13: on standing, phosphotungstic
acid crystallizes. Its solution is said to give a distinct
precipitate with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>200000</sub> of a grain of strychnia and
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>100000</sub> of quina, and with similar amounts of other alkaloids.
From this precipitate the alkaloid is obtained by treating with
sufficient milk of lime and shaking with ether-chloroform,
&amp;c., as before. He recommends the previous removal of
impurities by lead acetate and sulphuretted hydrogen as
already described (p. 7) (Fresenius, Zeitschr. f. anal. Chemie,
12, 315).</p>

<p>6. <i>Picric acid</i>, a saturated aqueous solution, gives precipitates
in <i>neutral</i> solutions of morphia and atropia. In
solutions acidified with sulphuric acid it gives the following:&mdash;morphia,
and pseudomorphia, no precipitate; aconitia, a precipitate
only in concentrated solutions; other alkaloids of
opium, a thick precipitate.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>7. <i>Animal charcoal</i>, previously purified by hydrochloric
acid and thorough washing with water, when digested with
neutral or alkaline solutions of alkaloids, not too dilute,
absorbs them from the liquid. The charcoal, washed twice
or thrice with small quantities of water, is dried at a
moderate temperature, and boiled with strong alcohol, which
extracts the alkaloid. This process has been used for
separating picrotoxin from beer, but has the inconvenience
that the alkaloid is liable to gradual oxidation within the
pores of the charcoal, and that the separation is never complete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It is this property that has caused charcoal to be
recommended as an antidote in poisoning.</p>

<p>8. All alkaloids form with <i>platinic chloride</i> double salts of
more or less sparing solubility. These precipitates, washed,
dried and weighed, and then burnt, leave metallic platinum,
the amount of which yields a clue to the composition of the
base. But aconitine and narcotine are only thrown down from
concentrated solutions, and a few are not precipitated at all.
Hence this test is of only occasional value in toxicological
work. The same may be said of <i>auric chloride</i>.</p>

<p>9. <i>Tannin</i> or tannic acid, a moderately strong solution in
water, throws down most alkaloids. Coffee and tea, and
other tannin-containing infusions, have, therefore, been used
as antidotes with dubious success. As a test it is not distinctive.</p>

<p>10. <i>Phospho-antimonic acid</i> (Schultze), prepared by mixing
antimony pentachloride with ordinary sodium phosphate and
decanting the clear liquid, gives whitish amorphous precipitates
with alkaloids.</p>

<p>11. <i>Silico-tungstic acid</i> is prepared by boiling commercial
tungstate of soda with fresh gelatinous silica. Filter and
allow to crystallize. This gives precipitates with very dilute
solutions of alkaloids, but it is also precipitated by ammonium
chloride (Godefroy, Arch. d. Pharm., Nov. 1879). Zaubenheimer
recommends it as a most delicate test: the precipitate
may be decomposed by soda or potash, and the base extracted
by ether-chloroform.</p>

<p>12. Auric chloride, palladious chloride, and mercuric
chloride have been proposed, but are not of much use.
Potassium chromate and sulphocyanide, and sodium nitroprusside
give somewhat insoluble precipitates, generally
crystalline and of characteristic appearance under the microscope.
These tests should be strong, and must be used in
small quantity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptomaines or Cadaveric Alkaloids.</span>&mdash;Much attention has
been attracted lately by the possible interference to toxicological
detections owing to the undoubted existence of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
alkaloids in the dead body unpoisoned. Some of these,
called by Selmi “Ptomaines” ([Greek: ptôma], a corpse), somewhat
simulate strychnia, &amp;c., in their chemical and physiological
characters. The observation is not new, as years ago, in the
Privy Council’s reports, Thudichum called attention to alkaloids
separated by Sonnenschein’s process (phosphomolybdic
acid) from the brain, urine, and from decomposed bodies.
Various substances of the kind have also been found by other
investigators. To these “cadaveric alkaloids” have been
attributed the “sausage poisoning,” so frequent in Germany
(for cases, see Casper’s Handbook, vol. 3), poisoning by
various foods, such as tinned meats, cheese, &amp;c. Some are
irritants, others narcotics: different periods and circumstances
of putrefaction producing different compounds.</p>

<p>In an Italian criminal prosecution, F. Ciotto, who made the
investigation of the corpse, gave it as his opinion that strychnia
was probably present. Selmi, for the defence, pointed
out differences from strychnia, and considered the compound
to be a ptomaine. [Arch. Pharm. (3), 19, 187.] This will
show the importance of the subject.</p>

<p>Casali (Gazetta, 1881, 312) regards ptomaines as not true
alkaloids, but as “acid or basic amidated compounds.” It is
only the basic ones that will interfere with testing. Panum
and Bergmann have isolated a substance called “<i>sepsin</i>,”
generated by putrefaction, poisonous, acting like a ferment
but not destroyed by boiling, soluble in water, but insoluble
in alcohol, and thereby distinguished from alkaloids. Sonnenschein
and Zuelzer found a product of putrefaction which
produced tetanic symptoms, besides one resembling atropine.
But these substances, or similar ones, can be produced <i>without</i>
putrefaction, as Paterno and Spica have shown that fresh blood
and fresh albumen (white of egg) yielded, with phosphomolybdic
acid, potassio-mercuric iodide, and other alkaloidal reagents,
precipitates like those of the vegetal alkaloids. Selmi has even
supposed that death from various diseases may be due to the
formation of these compounds. The same author obtained
from a dead body one month after death a considerable amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of a <i>crystallizable</i> ptomaine, giving reactions like those of
alkaloidal poisons, and having poisonous effects on frogs.</p>

<p>Brouardel and Bouting (Compt. Rend. 92, 1056) propose
the reducing action of ptomaines as a distinction between them
and vegetal alkaloids. The solution in weak acid is added to
a dilute mixture of ferric chloride and potassium ferricyanide:
the latter, if a ptomaine be present, is reduced to ferrocyanide,
and Prussian blue is thereby precipitated. But Spica (Gazetta,
11, 486) has shown that strychnia, brucia, morphia, and some
others produce this reaction readily, and Beckurts (Arch.
Pharm. 3, 20, 104) adds aconitine and others as producing it
slowly. Hence the distinction is delusive. See also Husemann
(Arch. Pharm. 3, 16, 169; also 3, 20, 270), Tauret
(Compt. Rend. 92, 1163).</p>

<p>The discovery of these bodies has certainly raised a new
difficulty for toxicologists, and suggested a new and plausible
defence, as it must be confessed that at present there is no
general method of distinguishing between “cadaveric” and
vegetal alkaloids. Yet this mainly affects the “physiological”
tests&mdash;on frogs and other small animals&mdash;for there is no
ptomaine yet discovered which gives <i>all</i> the reactions of
strychnia, morphia, &amp;c. If a chemist be asked, “Could any
other substance produce these reactions?” he can only answer,
“I do not know of any”; he cannot aver the impossibility.
Then the circumstantial evidence must decide.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the following principles should be noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The quantity of poison found is generally only a small
fraction of the quantity taken. The vomit and evacuations
are frequently lost, and much may be decomposed by vital
actions in the body, or by putrefaction. That which has
caused death is probably thereby either decomposed or so
combined as to be rendered undetectible: that which is found
is merely the surplus beyond the fatal dose. This would
account for the frequent non-discovery in the tissues when a
small amount has been given, or much time has elapsed.
To metallic poisons this does not apply, as, unless eliminated,
they can always be found. See further under Strychnia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The symptoms will differ according to the dose, the form
(solid or solution, pure or admixed), habit, or idiosyncrasy,
the state of health, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. In the post-mortem examination, appearances common
to dead bodies generally are often mistaken for the effects of
poison. See Casper’s Handbook, vol. I., <i>et passim</i>.</p>

<p>4. Unhealthy or improper food or acute disease may cause
suspicious symptoms. This is the commonest solution of
suspected poisoning.</p>

<p>5. In experiments on animals, it may be objected that they
are inconclusive as to man. This is not strictly true. But if
a <i>recent vomit</i> proves poisonous to an animal, <i>with the same
symptoms as in the man</i>, that is almost conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>6. When a poison is not found by analysis, it does not follow
that it has not caused death. Unequal distribution, uncertainty
of tests, improper securing of the samples (Palmer
case), decomposition or elimination of the poison, may hinder
discovery.</p>

<p>7. In every case, if possible, the approximate <i>quantity</i> of
the poison should be ascertained and stated. This specially
applies to substances that <i>may</i> have been administered
medicinally.</p>

<p>“If poison be administered <i>with intent to murder</i>, it is not
necessary that there should be enough in the article administered
to cause death, or that it should be given in such a way
as to act fatally. If any poison be there, and the intent be
proved, the crime of attempting to administer poison is complete.”

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>March 12, 13, and 14</i>, 1845, <span class="smcap">Spring Assizes, Aylesbury</span>, <i>before</i>
<span class="smcap">Baron Parke</span>.</p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p>The trial of John Tawell, of Berkhampstead, Berks, for
the murder of Sarah Hart, at Hall Place, Slough, attracted
more than usual attention, from the cruelty of the act in
poisoning the woman whom he had seduced, the position and
popular character of the murderer as a benevolent and hospitable
Quaker, noted for his charities, and the novelty of the
mode by which his detection was mainly insured. The
electric telegraph had only very lately been established on the
line of the Great Western Railway, and though Tawell lost
no time after committing the act, in getting into the train for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
London at Slough, the telegraph outstripped him, and on his
arrival at the Paddington station he was recognised, and tracked
to his lodgings, and thus his immediate arrest secured.</p>

<p>Tawell’s life had been of a remarkable character. Originally
a commercial traveller, he had exhibited a strange mixture of
great shrewdness and money-making talent, combined with
an outward show of religious observance. As a young man
he had been indicted for forging a bill for £1000, and had he
been tried on the counts for forging, or uttering, he would
doubtless have been executed. By some influence, however,
he was allowed to plead guilty to the count for having the bill
in his possession (a <i>nolle prosequi</i> being entered on the others),
and sentenced to transportation for life. “Accordingly,” says
Mr. Justice Therry, who knew him well in Sydney, “he came
out to the colony as a convict. Besides being a commercial
traveller for some time, he had been in an apothecary’s
shop in England, and on obtaining partial exemption from
convict discipline, became the principal druggist in Sydney.
After a prosperous career he sold his business for, it was said,
£14,000, and judiciously invested this sum in buildings and
other pursuits of profit. For nearly two years he occupied
the house opposite to mine in Sydney, which gave me almost
daily opportunity then of seeing him. He struck me as being
a remarkably well-conducted person. He had once been a
member of the Society of Friends; he wore a broad-brimmed
hat, appeared always in a neat and carefully adjusted costume,
and his whole appearance and manner impressed one with the
notion of his being a very saintly personage. He always
sought the society in public of persons of reputed piety. I
have often met him in the street accompanied by a secretary
or collector to a charitable institution, whom he assisted in
obtaining contributions for benevolent objects. At one time
he took up the cause of temperance in such an intemperate
and silly spirit, that he ordered a puncheon of rum he had
imported to be staved on the wharf at Sydney, and its contents
poured into the sea, saying that, ‘he would not be instrumental
to the guilt of disseminating such poison throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the colony.’ At another time his zeal took an apparently
religious turn. He built, in Macquarie Street, Sydney, a commodious
meeting-house for the Society of Friends, on the
front of which was inscribed on a large square stone inserted
in the wall some such words as these&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh">
<span class="smcap">John Tawell<br />
to<br />
The Society of Friends.</span></p>

<p>He conveyed no title, however, to the Society to secure them
the tenure of the property. After his execution it was sold, I
understood, with other portions of his property, for the benefit
of the party entitled to it under his will, the Crown having
waived its right to the forfeiture of the estate.</p>

<p>“Tawell was himself a liberal contributor to charities, and the
opinion of his character was so favourable, that the act for which
he suffered created great astonishment in Sydney. A considerable
part of his money had been realised by buying up all
the whalebone that trading vessels, at an early period, imported
into Sydney. This he sent to a London house, where
it was manufactured into combs, handles for brushes, and
various other articles of domestic use. He was the first
person in the colony who converted whalebone into an article
of profitable export. When he left the colony, he had a considerable
property from rents and other sources which became
much reduced by the general distress that prevailed in New
South Wales in 1843.” Hence the anxiety expressed by him
for his Sydney letters, referred to in the course of his trial.
Still, however, a man of good means, occupying a respected
position in his town, and noted, through a long and industrious
life, for his benevolence and straightforward conduct in his
relations with his neighbours, he might well say when first
charged with the murder of his mistress, “My station in
society places me beyond suspicion.” Such had been the
remarkable career, and such was the ostensible character of
the man to whom the most cold-blooded of murders was
clearly brought home in the following trial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>At the trial before Mr. Baron Parke, at Aylesbury, on the
12th, 13th, and 14th of March, 1845, Sergeant Byles and
Mr. Prendergast appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Fitzroy
Kelly, Q.C., Mr. Gunning, and Mr. O’Malley, assisted by
Messrs. Herapath, of Bristol, Professor Graham and Dr.
Letheby, of London, the eminent chemists, for the defence.</p>

<p>In consequence of the excitement in the county caused by
the event, numerous objections were taken to jurymen by the
prisoner’s counsel. At length, however, a jury was formed,
and after a brief recapitulation of the leading facts of the
proposed evidence by Sergeant Byles, Mary Ashley, a next
door neighbour of the deceased, was called, who had seen
Tawell go to Sarah Hart’s between 4 and 5 in the afternoon
of the 1st of January, and between 6 and 7 the same evening,
“hearing a sort of stifled scream,” had gone to her door with
a candle and seen him leaving the cottage. The cottages
stood in a row, with small gardens in front, with rails and
gates, and contained four rooms, two on the ground floor, and
the same number above.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The prisoner,” said the witness, “appeared to be agitated, and
unable to open the gate. I opened it for him; it was fastened
with a small button. When I went out of my house, I said, ‘I
am afraid my neighbour is ill’&mdash;not speaking to any person in
particular, but as the prisoner was then coming down the garden
I should think that I spoke loud enough for him to hear me: I
was about six yards from him. No reply was made by him. When
I got to the gate I could hear Mrs. Hart still making the same
description of noise: the prisoner made me no answer when I
asked him if I should open the gate; he appeared very much
agitated, and was trying in a hurried manner to open the gate; he
came out of the gate before I went in; I saw his face; I held the
candle over the gate to open it: I have no doubt that he is the
same man, though I had never seen him before that afternoon.
In the afternoon Mrs. Hart said to me, ‘I expect my old master,
but perhaps he will not come till to-morrow.’ When I got to
Mrs. Hart’s door it was shut, and upon my opening it I saw
Mrs. Hart lying on the floor with her head not a great way from
the door; her legs were towards the fire, her dress was quite in a
disordered state, her petticoats nearly up to her knees, her left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stocking down to her ankle, and torn, and her left shoe off: her
cap was off, and her hair hanging down over her head: her cap
was a little distance from her: she was still making a noise, and
her eyes were fixed, but her lips moving. I took hold of her
hands and raised her head, and said, ‘Oh, Mrs. Hart, what is the
matter?’ She did not make any answer, but I thought she
seemed to press my hand, but I could not positively tell. I then
raised her up, and a little froth came out of her mouth, and I
thought she was dying. I laid her down again, and took my
candle and went into Mrs. Wheeler’s house, next door but one.
When I went into Mrs. Hart’s I observed a bottle and a glass by
the side of it half full, and another glass on the opposite side of
the table, near the door, empty; but there appeared to be something
in the bottom of it. A chair was beside Mrs. Hart, and
another opposite her. I returned from Mrs. Wheeler’s with
Mrs. Barrett, and we placed a pillow on the child’s chair and
bathed her temples. One of Mrs. Barrett’s apprentices went for
Dr. Champneys, and he came. I searched the place immediately,
and found no small vial about the size of a thimble. There was a
middling fire in the house. Before I got into the house I thought
the prisoner was looking, and I locked the door, because I was
frightened. The deceased was breathing hard in a short way,
and making a noise like ‘oh! oh!’ and her eyes looked very full.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> by <i>Mr. Kelly</i>, she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That she heard Mrs. Hart’s voice rather loud after Mr. Tawell
went in&mdash;only a few words, but could not hear what she said.
She did not think that they were quarrelling, but that perhaps
Mrs. Hart was in hysterics, as money matters were always talked
over when Tawell came. When Mr. Champneys came in, he said
he must try to bleed her: he did so, and there was about as much
blood as would cover a plate; she died immediately afterwards;
indeed, I think she was dead when he bled her. About Christmas
Mrs. Hart received a basket of apples as a present&mdash;about a peck,
some of which were left in a box.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i>, she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That it was not more than a minute after she left her own
house that she entered Mrs. Hart’s, and that she saw about ten
or a dozen apples in the box after her death.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mrs. Barrett</i> confirmed Mrs. Ashley’s account of the
condition in which she found the deceased, but did not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
any foam on her lips until after she tried to pour some water
down her throat.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It was then proved by the barmaid at the “Windmill,” on
Salthill, and a gardener, that about half after six on that day
the deceased came there for a bottle of Guinness’s stout, and
that she was met between her house and the “Windmill” about
the same time in high spirits running towards her cottage.</p>

<p>The next witness spoke to the acts of the prisoner before
he arrived at the cottage. At three o’clock in the afternoon
he had been at the Jerusalem Coffee-house, inquiring at what
hour they closed, saying he was going to the West End, and
should not be back until half-past eight, and wishing to leave
a greatcoat and a parcel, which, by arrangement with the
waiter, he fetched away about half-past nine or a quarter to
ten that night, leaving his umbrella there. Other witnesses
proved his being seen running from Bath Place towards
Slough, getting into the Eton omnibus and stopping opposite
Sir John Herschel’s house, then returning towards the Slough
station and leaving it for Paddington by the half-past eight
train.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The evidence of the next witness, who tracked him
from the moment of his arrival at Paddington, must be given
in detail.</p>

<p><i>William Williams</i> said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am a sergeant of police on the Great Western Railway, at
Paddington Station. On the 1st of January, in consequence of a
telegraphic communication, I observed the prisoner get out of a
carriage and get into a New Road omnibus. I put on a private
coat, and acted as guard. He got out opposite Princes’ Street,
near the Bank, about a quarter past nine. I opened the door on
purpose to look at him; he went towards the Wellington Statue,
and then crossed over to Birch’s, the pastrycooks: he stood a
moment, as if he was considering; I watched him from behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
statue. He then went towards the Jerusalem Coffee-house, and I
followed him; he then went down a court into Birchin Lane, and
from thence to Scott’s Yard, in the Borough, where he lodged,
where I left him. On returning there next morning he was gone,
so I went to the Jerusalem, and an officer (<i>Wiggins</i>) went in and
took him into custody. Wiggins said to him that he was last seen
in the house of a woman at Slough who was found dead, when he
replied that, ‘I was not at Slough yesterday&mdash;I know no one
there.’ I then remarked that I had seen him get off the train
from Slough, and that he had given me sixpence after riding in
the omnibus from the Paddington station. ‘You must be mistaken,’
he replied; ‘my station in life must rebut any suspicion that
might be attached to me.’”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Wiggins</i>, an inspector of the Metropolitan police, gave a
graphic account of the arrest.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Thursday, the 2nd of January, I went into the Jerusalem
Coffee-house with the last witness, and asked the prisoner if his
name was Tawell; he said, ‘Yes.’ I then asked him if he had
been at Slough last night, and he said, ‘No, I did not leave town
all day yesterday.’ I then opened my coat, showed my uniform,
and said, ‘I want you concerning the woman you were with last
night.’ He said, ‘I don’t know anyone there.’ I said, ‘There
was a woman found dead there, and you are supposed to be the
last person who was seen with her alive.’ He said, ‘Thee must be
mistaken in the identity, my station in society places me beyond
suspicion.’ I then took him down to Salt Hill, to the ‘Three Tuns,’
where the inquest was being held. I searched him, and found
£12. 10<i>s.</i> in gold and £1. 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in silver, a gold watch, and a letter
addressed to him, which he said he had received from his wife.
On the second day of the inquest I saw him again. After consulting
with his lawyer, he said to me, ‘I took thee for a gentleman
in the railway carriage.’ I said, ‘I told you I was an officer.’
He replied, ‘Yes, but that was afterwards.’ The first day of the
inquest he said, ‘Mind, I have disclosed nothing.’”</p>

<p class="p1">In <i>cross-examination, Mr. Kelly</i> failed to get the witness to
say that when asked about Slough the prisoner said he came
from Berkhampstead, and only led the witness to reiterate
that he stated “that he had not been at Slough that day.”</p>

<p>To <i>Perkins</i>, the inspector of the Eton police, Tawell was
dangerously communicative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the day after I had taken him into custody,” said this
witness, “and brought him to my own house, after he had seen his
lawyer, he said to me, ‘The unfortunate woman once lived in my
service, about two years and a half, or nearly so.’ He asked me
if I knew this. I told him I had heard so. Then Holmes, the
other constable, came in, and he added, ‘She left my service about
five years ago.’ I told him whatever he said I should communicate
to the coroner to-morrow. He said, ‘he would have no
objection to that,’ and then continued, ‘she had been in the habit
of writing letters to him for money,’ and that he had been pestered
with her; she was a very good servant when in his service, but a
bad principled woman. She wrote to him that if he did not send
her something she would make away with herself. He came down
to her house and told her that he would not give her any more
money. She then asked him if he would not give her some porter.
I then sent for a bottle of stout, and she had a glass and I had a
glass. She then took out a small phial, about the size of a
thimble, and said, “I will, I will,” and poured some into her glass
and drank a part of it&mdash;the remainder was thrown into the fire.
She then done herself about and laid down on the hearth-rug; I
then went out. I did not think she was in earnest, otherwise I
would have called somebody.’ I asked him if he had got those
letters, and he said, ‘No, I never keep such letters as those.’ I
knew him by person, having seen him at Aylesbury.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> was unimportant&mdash;mainly directed
to the probable inaccuracy of his recollection and to the
nature of the communication he made to the coroner.
<i>Holmes</i>, in addition to confirming <i>Perkins’</i> report of the prisoner’s
statement, was present when Mrs. Tawell visited her
husband, when, in reply to her question, “what he had been
doing,” he replied, “Nothing. I hope you will forgive me.”</p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>H. Montague Champneys</i>, surgeon at Salthill, sent for a
few minutes before 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on January 1st, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I ran, and when I got there saw deceased on the floor, felt her
pulse, but am not certain whether I felt any pulsation. I put my
hand under her clothes over her heart, and could not discover any
pulsation; considered her dead, but still thought it best to open a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
vein in her arm, and obtained about an ounce of blood. Next day
I made a <i>post mortem</i> examination with Mr. Norblad and Mr.
Pickering. Having previously examined the external parts, we
opened the body, when I smelt the odour of prussic acid; the
lungs were perfectly healthy, but the coverings had the appearance
of inflammation. Examined stomach and contents. Rather more
mucus than there ought to be; the abdominal viscera perfectly
healthy. Put contents of stomach into a bottle, which I, with
Messrs. Norblad and Pickering, took to Mr. Cooper, in London.
The contents were tested for sulphuric acid, oxalic acid, and some
poisonous salts, but nothing was discovered; afterwards an experiment
was tried for prussic acid. Mr. Cooper tried protosulphate
of iron, and also nitrate of silver, but could not during the experiment
discover any prussic acid; but nevertheless, it is my opinion
that she died from the effects of that poison. On the following
Sunday I took the beer and the part of a bun found on the table
to Mr. Cooper, which were tested for prussic acid, but none discovered.
When I stated that in my opinion the deceased died
from the effects of prussic acid I did not know that the prisoner
had bought any. I know Scheele’s prussic acid and that of the
London Pharmacopœia; less than a grain of pure prussic acid
would be a dose; two drams of Scheele’s would contain six grains.
There are cases on record where the smell of prussic acid could
not be discovered in the stomach of a person who had taken it.
A person in Paris died from taking seven-tenths of a grain. Prussic
acid is volatile, and may be carried off by the lungs or absorbed by
the tissues. There is a case in the <i>Lancet</i> of a person dying from
having less than a grain administered to her. After this occurrence
I put thirty grains of Scheele’s acid into a glass of
Guinness’s stout, and the smell was scarcely perceptible. The
symptoms would come on in less than two minutes.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the very minute and detailed <i>cross-examination</i> to which
this witness was subjected by <i>Mr. Kelly</i>, he made the following
statements:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I have no experience in detecting the odour of prussic acid in
a human subject&mdash;should think it may be taken without detection;
should expect to find the odour in the mouth and in the breath,
but there may be exceptions. Neither Mr. Pickering nor Mr.
Norblad smelt it when the body was opened. It was not a conjecture
of mine; I was positive of it. The smell is very peculiar
and strong, and easy to be detected by those acquainted with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
It is more likely to be detected when exposed as this was to a heat
of 212 degrees. At every heat we tried to smell it, but failed.
There was no such smell in the blood which I drew shortly after
death. I am not competent to say whether epileptic patients die
more quickly from prussic acid than others. It is said to act
powerfully on the nervous system. Have read the case of the
seven epileptic patients who died from a dose of seven-tenths of a
grain each in from thirty to forty-five hours. There was a case in
which the French doctors discovered poison eight days after death.</p>

<p>“This acid exists in a great number of substances, in apples
for instance, and probably in many other substances in which it
has never been discovered. I agree with Dr. Christisön in his
opinion (p. 756) in respect of the formation of this acid in various
organic substances and other articles. It is made from the
blood, bones, and horns of animals. It consists of 12 carbon, 14
nitrogen, and 1 hydrogen. Those are its elements. They exist
and can be obtained in great quantities from various substances&mdash;cherry-stones,
and stones of various fruits; they are found in the
human saliva, but not in the form of prussic acid. It (the salt) is
called sulphocyanide, and when taken is perceptible in the blood
and breath, but most in the stomach.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In apple-pips or other
substances the smell would not be given off until disengaged by
some process for that purpose.</p>

<p>“During the experiments for oxalic acid and other poisons,
Messrs. Cooper, Pickering, and Norblad failed to perceive any
smell. One of them then came to the conclusion that there must
be prussic acid.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did Mr. Cooper then apply a process which would
set free prussic acid from apple-pips and other substances?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I believe that is the process, but it was not carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to the full extent. I refer to the heat. When this new process
was applied, the result was that prussic acid was found. I did not
smell it, nor anyone else. Beyond the smell in opening the body,
I smelt none at all.”</p>

<p>“When I first saw the deceased I thought I felt a few beats of
the pulse, but I imagine that I was mistaken. It might have been
the pulse in my own finger. The analogy between animals and
human beings dying of prussic acid is considered doubtful by the
best authorities. The heart would continue to beat for a short
time after the pulse had receded from the arms. The lungs might
be considered slightly congested.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kelly.</i>&mdash;“Why then inform my learned friend that they
were sound and healthy?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The lungs themselves were not diseased.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kelly.</i>&mdash;“Is it natural and healthy when the lungs are
congested?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“They contained rather more blood than usual.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kelly.</i>&mdash;“Is that a healthy state?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Not perfectly so.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kelly.</i>&mdash;“Is not congested lungs the cause of various modes
of sudden death?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I then examined the <i>pericardium</i>, it was empty. The heart
had a natural appearance. I do not recollect that I examined the
arteries proceeding from the aorta. Any disease of the coronary
arteries is likely to cause sudden death. I did not examine the
spinal marrow. The valves of the heart were very clear. Death
might suddenly result from the adhesion of the spinal marrow, if
it had existed some time. A sudden termination also might take
place where the disease is latent. I looked at the gall-bladder, the
colour was natural. My experience teaches me that prussic acid
would colour it blue.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I examined the œsophagus to see if there
was any foreign substance, and found none. I opened the trachea,
but not the bronchial tubes, so I could not tell whether there was
water in them or not. When I felt the pulse and heart of the
deceased I was satisfied that she was dead, still I bled her, as I
thought it best to try every means to restore animation. I did not
do it to ascertain the cause of death. I then got no information as
to the cause of death. I saw a slight motion of the jaw as I felt
the pulse, and apprehend she died then. I took the stomach from
the body eighteen hours after death. The contents were turned
into a jug or basin, and afterwards into a bottle. I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for what purpose the bottle had been used. I did not wash it out.”
(<i>The bottle was here produced, a large-mouthed one, like a pickle
bottle.</i>) The witness then stated what care he took of it to prevent
its being tampered with before taking it to Mr. Cooper:&mdash;“The
exact dose to cause death is still undetermined, also whether the
effect is cumulative or not, also the effect of the same quantity
diluted more or less is unsettled. Scheele’s prussic acid varies in
strength. Prussic acid evaporates by keeping.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kelly, reading from Watson’s “Lectures on Physic.”</i>&mdash;“Do
you agree to this&mdash;‘A blow, a fall, an electric shock, a teaspoonful
of prussic acid, may cause death and leave no trace on the nervous
system?’”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On his <i>re-examination</i> by <i>Serjt. Byles</i>, the witness said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In the case of the seven epileptic patients two medical men did
not smell the acid, but two chemists did some time afterwards. It
requires an extensive experience readily to detect the smell.
Some may perceive it, some not. Several persons should smell,
some not being so susceptible of the odour as others. I agree with
a French chemist that ‘under a considerable number of circumstances
there must be great practical knowledge to detect smell.’
If a person once knows the smell, I think he will know it again.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>“I should think that before prussic acid could be obtained from
horns, blood, and bones of animals, a heat of from 400 to 500
degrees would be necessary. All animals, whether human or not,
die if they take prussic acid. There is no difference in its operation
upon man and the inferior animals. There was no appearance of
disease in the heart of the deceased. Had there been any rupture
of the coronary arteries it would have been apparent. I never
knew such a disease of the spinal marrow to cause sudden death.
I know only of the two cases mentioned by Taylor of the gall
bladder having a blue tint. The absence of it is no proof that the
person did not die from prussic acid. The bottle into which I put
the contents was perfectly clean and dry. The ends of the stomach
were securely tied up with string when I moved the contents into
the jug, which was also perfectly dry and clean. I have no doubt
the deceased died from prussic acid.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">After two constables (<i>Hill</i> and <i>Larkin</i>) had proved the finding
of a phial in a cupboard and two others in a jug, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>

<p><i>Charlotte Howard</i>, unmarried, a servant, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I knew Mrs. Hart, and went to see her at Salthill on the 26th
September, 1843. She had a child of mine in her care. I was
there from three to four months, in which time I saw Mr. Tawell
there twice. On the 30th of September he came, and in ten
minutes after, Mrs. Hart sent me out for a bottle of stout, which I
got and gave to her. She took it into the room where he was.
Shortly after she came out and sent me for a sheet of paper,
leaving Mr. Tawell in the room with the stout. When I came
back she said to me ‘I am so ill, I shall be obliged to tell my
master to go; I am so sick, my head is so bad.’ She was very sick,
and I helped her upstairs to bed. After she got upstairs she was
sick again. She was in very good health when Tawell came. She
said she only drank one glass of porter and felt sick directly afterwards.
I went down again and saw eighteen sovereigns on the
table, which I put into a drawer. There was some porter in the
glasses and in the bottle. That in the glasses I threw away, and
drank that in the bottle, and it did not make me ill. Mrs. Hart
complained of being very giddy, but did not say anything about her
throat.”</p>

<p class="psh">ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cooper</i>, the Analytical Chemist and Lecturer on
Medical Jurisprudence, was then called and examined by
<i>Serjeant Byles</i>.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“On the 3rd of January,” said the witness, “Messrs. Champneys,
Norblad, and Pickering called on me with a carpet bag. The bag
contained a bottle (ordinary one, such as olives are usually sold in)
full or nearly so with the contents of the stomach; a portion of
porter in an ordinary beer-bottle, on which was a paper label
signifying that it contained Guinness’s beer; a glass tumbler, about
half full of what appeared to be a mixture of beer and water; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
part of a plum bun, and a phial containing a few drops (perhaps
about half a drachm) of a nearly colourless fluid; a small piece of
pink paper, such as is generally used by apothecaries for tying over
the corks of medicine phials, and had apparently been used for such
purpose; and the stomach and part of the intestines. The bottle
which contained the contents of the stomach was tied over with a
piece of bladder, and, I think, corked as well, but of the latter I
am not certain; it was opened and smelt strongly of food in the
progress of digestion, it had also the smell of beer. On the application
of litmus paper to the surface of the contents it became red
instantly, and so very red that I was disposed to consider that
Mr. Norblad and the other gentlemen were right in their conjecture
as to its containing oxalic acid. A portion was now taken out
of this bottle and put into a porcelain evaporating basin, to which
some distilled water was added, and stirred well together with a
glass rod; the basin with its contents was then placed on the
heated sand bath and kept stirring until it boiled, and even after it
had boiled for some minutes. During the whole of this operation
I was standing over it, and the vapour that escaped I smelt the
whole time, but did not recognise the slightest odour of prussic
acid; the odour was the same as that of the contents of the bottle,
but it was more powerful. The contents of the basin were then
put into a paper filter placed in a glass funnel, and that which
passed through the filter was collected in a glass vessel placed for
its reception. While this operation was going on I directed my
attention to the contents of the beer bottle and the tumbler. I found
them both to have an acid reaction on litmus paper, the contents
of the beer bottle very decidedly so; but on the application of the
usual tests employed for the detection of oxalic acid, not a trace of
it could be found.</p>

<p>“By this time a small quantity of clear liquid from the contents
of the basin had passed the filter; this was removed from the glass
vessel employed to receive it into a test glass, and on the application
of the tests for the detection of oxalic acid not the smallest
trace was indicated. I then felt quite certain that oxalic acid had
not been the cause of death.</p>

<p>“I was then shown the stomach by Messrs. Champneys and
Norblad, and on examining its interior surface it did not appear to
have been acted on by any corrosive substance: nevertheless I
thought it advisable to search for sulphuric acid, and accordingly
applied to a small portion of the liquid, filtered from that which
had been boiled, the test for that substance, but none could be
detected. In like manner I did also apply the tests for the detection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of baryta, opium, arsenic, the salts of mercury, and other
metallic poisons, and could find none of them. I then came to the
conclusion that, if the person had died from the effect of poison, it
could be no other than prussic acid.</p>

<p>“A portion of the contents of the stomach was then taken from
the bottle and put into a tubulated retort, to which was added a
very small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid; the retort with its
contents was placed on the sand bath, a receiver applied and a
portion distilled off. When about two drachms of clear liquid had
distilled over, it was removed from the receiver into a test glass,
about a grain of green sulphate of iron was added, and when this
was dissolved, a small quantity of solution of potassa. These were
allowed to remain a short time together and stirred with a glass
rod. Subsequently muriatic acid was added in sufficient quantity
<i>when instantly Prussian blue appeared</i>, which could not have
resulted unless cyanogen or hydrocyanic acid had been present.
But it could not be recognised by the smell. Although I had no
doubt in my own mind, from the gentle heat that had been
employed in the above detailed process of distillation, that the
prussic acid could not have resulted from any decomposition of the
animal matters present in the contents of the stomach, yet I
thought it prudent to conduct the process of distillation in such a
manner as to preclude the possibility of such occurrence.</p>

<p>“Another and much larger portion of the contents of the stomach
was put into another retort, to which a little dilute sulphuric acid
was added as before, and the retort with its contents placed in a
water bath, to which some common salt was added. The salt-water
bath was heated until it boiled; a receiver was put on to
the retort, an adapter intervening so as to remove the receiver to a
greater distance from the furnace, and the receiver was kept as cool
as possible by folds of blotting paper kept constantly wet applied
to its external surface. In this manner was the distillation slowly
conducted, until about an ounce of clear liquid had distilled over.”</p>

<p>On the removal of this liquid from the receiver it had the same
smell as that contained in the bottle had before distillation, and
neither myself, Mr. Norblad, Mr. Champneys, nor my son could
detect the smell of prussic acid in the slightest degree. In fact the
odour of beer and digesting food was so powerful as to cover or
disguise the smell of the prussic acid in this weak state, but on
applying the same tests as before Prussian blue was found in considerable
quantity.</p>

<p>“The few drops of liquid which were in the phial before mentioned
were now examined: they had no action on litmus paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they smelt of camphor and acetate of ammonia. The test for
prussic acid was applied, but it did not show the smallest quantity.
The phial was then washed out, and the distilled liquid, with the
precipitated Prussian blue obtained by the two above-detailed processes
was put into it. It was corked up and taken by Messrs.
Norblad and Champneys to keep in their possession. I also added
the same test to distilled water containing a few drops of prussic
acid, for the sake of comparison and to try the test. This was also
taken by Messrs. Norblad and Champneys, as was also some distilled
water with the same tests applied, to which no prussic acid had
been added, and which was colourless. As far as I can recollect
this completed the first day’s proceedings, it being now nearly dark.</p>

<p>“On the evening of the following day (Saturday) Mr. Pickering
came to me to request I would on the Monday following examine,
by the coroner’s desire, the contents of the glass tumbler, the beer
bottle, and the remainder of the beer, to determine if prussic acid
existed in any of them. On Sunday the 6th, being engaged at
Derby on the Monday, Messrs. Norblad and Champneys came,
bringing with them the whole of the things they took away with
them on the Friday. The beer, the contents of the tumbler, and
the remains of the plum bun we each subjected separately to
distillation in the salt-water bath, and to the liquor obtained by
distillation the same tests for detecting prussic acid were added,
but not a trace could be found.</p>

<p>“I may here observe that, on the intervening Saturday, I
continued the distillation of the larger portion before spoken of for
the purpose of obtaining more of the distilled liquid, and in fact to
continue the distillation until the whole of the prussic acid had
been separated. A part of the distilled liquor had its Prussian
blue precipitated, which was given to Messrs. Norblad and
Champneys on the Sunday, and to another part I added nitrate of
silver for the purpose of separating the hydrocyanic acid, or rather
the cyanogen it contained. I kept it safe from decomposition or
change during my absence, and for the purpose of further experiments
on my return, and at my leisure.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, shortly after my return, I put the cyanide of
silver obtained by the above process, together with some very
dilute muriatic acid, into a small retort, to which a receiver was
attached. The retort was placed over a lamp in order to be
heated, and the receiver was surrounded by cold water. The distillation
proceeded until about a drachm and a half had distilled
over. <i>This liquor possessed the odour of prussic acid</i>, distinctly
recognised by myself, and also by two of my sons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“It occurred to me that as Messrs. Norblad, Champneys, and
myself had distinctly seen among the contents of the stomach
some undigested apples, that the seeds or pips of the apple might
give rise to the formation of prussic acid by distillation. I therefore
determined on making an experiment to see if any and what
quantity of prussic acid they were capable of producing. Accordingly
the seeds from fifteen apples were bruised and put into a
retort with some distilled water, and about an ounce of liquor was
distilled off. On the application of the tests before spoken of,
Prussian blue, in exceeding small quantity, was produced. On
testing the last product of distillation, no Prussian blue was found.
I have the whole of the Prussian blue thus produced.</p>

<p>“About ten days ago I was applied to and requested to make
more experiments for the purpose (if possible) of discovering the
whole amount of prussic acid originally contained in the contents
of the stomach, or at least of that portion brought to me. I
stated that I had not the means in my possession of doing so, and
that Mr. Norblad or Mr. Champneys possessed almost everything
relating to the matter; but I thought it possible, if I had the
remainder of the contents of the stomach, and that if it were
contained in the same bottle in which it was originally brought, I
might be able to do so&mdash;having a distinct recollection of about the
height at which the matter stood in the neck of the bottle. Mr.
Champneys, on Saturday, the 8th of February, delivered, with
other matters, into my charge, the remainder of the contents of
the stomach which had not before been subjected to any operation
or experiment, and which, when I gave it him back, after my
former experiments, I requested him to keep in a cool dark place
for further investigation, should it be deemed requisite. The
bottle was tightly corked and securely tied over with a piece of
bladder. Before uncorking it, I made a mark with a file outside
the bottle coincident with the surface of the contents in the
interior. I then emptied the contents into a glass alembic, washed
the bottle out with a little distilled water, and added this to the
matter in the alembic. The head of the alembic was then put on,
a condensing apparatus attached, the alembic placed as before on
a salt-water bath, the bath brought to the boiling point, and distillation
conducted until the whole of the prussic acid was expelled.
A solution of nitrate of silver was put into the recipient for the
purpose of seizing hold of the hydrocyanic acid the moment it
reached that vessel. By this process I succeeded in obtaining
1·455 grains of dry cyanide of silver, very slightly contaminated
with chloride of silver. The latter did not amount to a quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which could be collected and weighed. But if I allow 0·025 grains,
and call the quantity of cyanide of silver produced in reality 1·43
on the quantity operated on in this instance, it must be very near
the truth. But as the quantity operated on in this instance
formed only 51 parts out of the 180 of the whole volume of the
contents of the bottle as it was first brought to me, the following
proportion will show how much was contained in the whole. For
if 51 parts give 1·43 grains of cyanide of silver, 180 parts will give
5·047 grains of cyanide of silver. This quantity of cyanide of
silver is equivalent to 1·002 grains of real hydrocyanic or prussic
acid, which is equal to 50 grains of the prussic acid of the strength
of the London Pharmacopeia. The determination of the relative
quantity operated on, and the original volume of the contents of
the stomach, was ascertained by measuring, with water, the bottle
filled, as near as possible to remember, to that part in the neck
where the contents originally stood, which was 180½ drachms, and
to the mark made by the file 51½ drachms.</p>

<p>“I may also remark that the contents of the stomach, after
distillation, was still strongly acid, occasioned most probably by the
acid in the beer, and also by the acid which is invariably produced
during the process of digestion.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">During his <i>examination, Mr. Cooper</i> produced the bottles
containing the Prussian blue produced from the stomach and
from the apple-pips&mdash;the former dark blue in colour, the latter
hardly more than tinged with it. When placed side by side on
the front of the witness-box the marked contrast caused much
excitement in Court.</p>

<p>The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness by <i>Mr. Kelly</i> was so
important, that though very lengthy it is necessary to give it
in considerable detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Until this case,” said the witness, “I had never examined the
contents of a human stomach where a person had been killed by
prussic acid, or a human stomach containing prussic acid. Respecting
the effect of prussic acid on the stomach and tissues of
the body, my knowledge is only theoretical. Prussic acid, which
I have smelt from its most concentrated to its weakest state, has
a peculiar smell; it affects different persons differently. When I
smell it, it affects spasmodically the back of the throat. But it
loses its smell in combinations. I am not aware what quantity of
prussic acid destroys life. I have no practical knowledge on the
subject. The case I am most familiar with is that of the seven
epileptics.</p>

<p>“I began my investigation with the view of seeing if oxalic acid
was present. I recognised the odour of beer more strongly in the
contents of the stomach than anything else. I did not trace the
smell of prussic acid in them, nor feel any spasmodic affection in
the throat in smelling them. I did not come to the conclusion,
after trying for those acids and mercurial poisons, which I did not
discover, that there was prussic acid in the stomach, but I remarked
to those present at that time, ‘Well, if this person has taken
poison, it must be prussic acid.’</p>

<p>“I have no idea how much Prussian blue I obtained from the
first experiment, as it was made in a hurry. (<i>The bottle of dark
blue liquid was here shown again.</i>) I thought the obtaining evidence
of its presence sufficient. I got more Prussian blue in the
second experiment than in the first, and more in the third experiment
than the second. I have not calculated the total amount of
Prussian blue in the bottle.”</p>

<p><i>As to the contents of the stomach</i>: “There was undigested flesh
and a pulpy mass of which I could make nothing, and some
portion of apple, but no pips either partially digested or undigested
with the apple. I am not prepared to say that the pips of this
apple contained more prussic acid than others. There is a great
difference between bitter and sweet apples&mdash;<i>the bitter contain a
great deal of prussic acid, the sweet, I believe, none</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><i>As to prussic acid being in many substances</i>: “Strictly speaking, I
don’t think it exists in any substance, not even in bitter almonds.
I mean in a free state; it is so extremely volatile that it cannot
possibly exist unless in combination with some other substance.
It is my opinion that prussic acid is a ‘product,’ and not an
‘educt’&mdash;that is to say, in consequence of its great volatility it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
cannot exist unless in combination with some other substance; you
liberate it by combination and change. The elements of it exist
in a great many substances. These elements, on taking new arrangements,
may produce prussic acid. Therefore I feel that it
is always a ‘product,’ and that it does not exist in any substance
in a free state, because if it did it would be continually evaporating
from that substance.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are not the substances which are already known to
contain the elements of prussic acid, and from which it can be
obtained, very numerous?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They are very numerous certainly, because all those
compounds which contain carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen,
may, in my opinion, by new changes be made to produce prussic
acid. All animal substances of any kind contain those elements,
in which are contained the elements of prussic acid. I agree, as
far as I know, with Christison, that the distilled seeds of bitter
almonds, and pomaceous seeds, yield prussic acid by distillation.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is it not found, from time to time, by accident or
experiment, to exist in organic and other matters?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I believe it is. I was the first person to discover it
in fulminating silver, and perhaps also in apple-pips, from recent
experiments. I am not aware of it ever having been produced by
mere organic changes in the stomach. If the apple-pips on which
I operated had been macerated, I cannot say that I should have
obtained more Prussian blue. I know it is the habit to macerate
bitter almonds, but I also know that without maceration they have
sometimes yielded more prussic acid than with maceration.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“I will ask you one question more, ‘Do you agree
with Dr. Taylor that the odour of prussic acid, which is said to be
peculiar, may be found when all tests fail?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“<i>I do not believe it.</i> As far as my experience goes, it
would lead me to the contrary conclusion.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“But if I understand you rightly, you do not smell
prussic acid, but feel its effects in another way?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Sometimes it has produced a spasmodic constriction
about the throat, without my smelling it. At other times I have
distinctly smelt it. It depends very much, I think, on the state
of the nasal organ at the time.”</p>

<p><i>To Serjeant Byles.</i>&mdash;“The same peculiar action at the back of the
throat is, I think, felt by others on putting prussic acid to the nose.
I communicated the nature of my evidence to the solicitor of the
prisoner about a month ago.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Parke.</i>&mdash;“Have you or have you not a doubt upon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
mind from the result of your experiments as to the existence of
prussic acid in the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“None whatever! I have no doubt that prussic acid
may exist without being smelt.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Parke.</i>&mdash;“If there was an absence of smell, would you
suppose that the prussic acid was present in the shape of a salt, and
that, therefore, you did not smell it?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Absence of smell may arise from dilution, or from its
being covered by the smell of other substances.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Parke.</i>&mdash;“Do you, in this particular case, ascribe the
absence of smell to the circumstance of the prussic acid being in the
form of a salt?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>No, because it could not exist in the stomach as a
cyanide of potassium, which is a salt, or as a cyanide of soda, when
another and more powerful acid was present; as, for instance, muriatic
acid, which in this case was found in considerable quantity, it being an
acid generated by the process of digestion.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Baron Parke.</i>&mdash;“Do you not believe that there was also acetic
acid present. Is not that a strong acid?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I have no doubt there was also acetic acid present, and
it would have a greater affinity for soda or potash than prussic
acid. I think prussic acid cannot be formed by putrefaction in the
stomach.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Joseph Cooper</i>, a son of the last witness, and his
assistant for four years, deposed to having smelt the ordinary
prussic acid at the time in the process, mentioned by his
father.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Norblad</i>, surgeon and apothecary at Slough for 10
years, said:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“On January 2 I went to Mrs. Hart’s house and saw her body;
have heard the evidence of Mr. Champneys, and should say that
death was caused by prussic or oxalic acid; do not know of any
other poisons that would produce death so rapidly; was present at
Mr. Cooper’s experiments; have heard and perfectly agree with his
evidence; oxalic acid must have been detected if present; I am
quite of opinion that prussic acid was present in the stomach, and
have no doubt about it; have heard the evidence of the witness
Howard, the symptoms she describes (of supposed former attempt)
are precisely those of prussic acid. That acid acts uniformly upon
all animal subjects, and destroys life in the same way in all cases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Have tried experiments on dogs, and have seen cats and dogs
poisoned by that acid. On the 18th February I made an experiment
on two dogs. Five hours after feeding them I gave one of
them half an ounce and the other one drachm of Scheele’s acid,
administered it at 7 p.m., and exactly in ten seconds after receiving
the smaller dose the dog fell as if dead, and the other in half the
time; <i>I opened their bodies eighteen hours after and could not
discover any odour</i>; I smelt the mouth of the dog and could not
detect it then, nor at any other time; I opened the stomach of the
dog, which smelt intensely of sour beer, the acid having been
administered in beer. I attributed the absence of smell to the
admixture of Guinness’s stout; I should have expected on opening
Mrs. Hart’s body to have discovered the cause of death.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“I examined the brain; it was perfectly healthy;
death did not arise from apoplexy.”</p>

<p><i>By Serjeant Byles.</i>&mdash;“Less than a grain of pure prussic acid
would be sufficient to produce death.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Cross-examined</i> by <i>Mr. Kelly</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I have never attended any one who had taken prussic acid
except in the form of medicine. The average dose of Scheele’s is
five minims, and a minim is about a grain. Never heard of prussic
acid being administered externally for varicose veins, and should
think it useless (<i>prescription handed to him</i>). That is a proper
prescription for varicose veins. I agree with Dr. Thompson, of
London, that prussic acid may be applied successfully to diseases of
the skin and cancerous affections to alleviate pain. I consider my
sense of smell very acute. <i>I mixed twelve grains of prussic acid
with a pint of porter, but could not smell it. Some porter dropped on
the table and I did then smell it.</i> I know that prussic acid when
combined with the blood of an animal volatilises very rapidly when
exposed to the air. There is a case in which prussic acid appears
to have allayed irritation of the stomach; it is a useful medicine
sometimes in small doses. I have seen dogs vomit after it. Disease
of the heart would produce death from mental emotion or rupture
of the coronaries of the heart. Forcing water down the throat of a
person in a syncope might cause sudden death. There was no
congestion or gorging of the lungs. I saw but did not examine
specially the coronary arteries.”</p>

<p><i>Kelly.</i>&mdash;“If sudden death had occurred from a disease of the
coronary arteries, what would be the appearance of the lungs?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The lungs have nothing to do with the coronary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
arteries; ossification of them is supposed to cause sudden death.
The blood in the lungs would not be prevented from returning
the heart so as to gorge the lungs. I did not see any symptoms of
the coronary arteries being ossified.”</p>

<p>“I examined the lungs carefully. The lungs have been found
gorged in some persons who have died of prussic acid. I don’t
think that what has been called congestion was always clearly so.
In all cases of paralysis of the heart, the blood has not been returned
to the heart, and remaining in it gorges the lungs. Death by
prussic acid paralyses the heart. In death from prussic acid, death
is often denoted by an involuntary scream. I cannot say that I
have heard of a succession of screams in any case of the kind.
When I first saw the body, my impression was that death had been
caused by oxalic acid, and that impression continued until the tests
were applied. Blackness of the stomach is a symptom. There was
a dark spot on the surface of the stomach. I have not seen a case
of poisoning by oxalic acid.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Re-examined by Mr. Prendergast.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“There was nothing in the stifled screams described by Mrs.
Ashley yesterday at all inconsistent with poisoning by prussic acid;
on the contrary, the catching of the breath is the last symptom.
Less than one grain of prussic acid will kill a healthy person.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“I saw nothing on the brain to indicate death by
apoplexy. If a sudden emotion had caused death I don’t think I
could have told that by the brain.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Mr. Pickering, who had been in practice as a surgeon for
nine years, and was present when Mr. Champneys made the
first incision through the integuments, said he then smelt
the odour of prussic acid,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and confirmed the accounts of
the previous witnesses of the experiments in Mr. Cooper’s
laboratory. On <i>cross-examination</i> he admitted that before
they examined the body they were led to suppose that the
death had been caused by poison, and that he had never
seen a case of death from poisoning either by oxalic or prussic
acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Previous visits of Tawell to Mrs. Hart, were proved by
<i>Kesiah Harding</i>, a washerwoman at Slough, in December,
1844, and particularly on the Monday week before her death,
when he told the deceased that he wished her to be alone
when he next came, and that he would come on the Tuesday
or Saturday week.</p>

<p class="psh">PURCHASE OF PRUSSIC ACID BY TAWELL.</p>

<p>This was proved by <i>Henry Thomas</i>, shopman to a Mr.
Hughes, a chemist in Bishopsgate Street, who said,</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the 1st of January, between twelve and two the prisoner
came to the shop dressed in a great coat and usual quaker garb
and asked for two drachms of Scheele’s Prussic Acid, bringing
with him a ½oz. bottle with a regular label of Scheele’s Acid on
it. As I could not get the stopper out, I gave it him in one of
our own bottles. When about to put on a label, I believe the
prisoner said “You need not,” but I would not swear it. He
said he wanted it for an external application to varicose veins,
paid 4<i>d.</i> for it, which was entered in the book now produced.
Next day he came again between ten and two and asked for the
same quantity, and, as he had broken our bottle, took it in the
one he had originally brought. I had seen him frequently before
and might have sold him prussic acid, but am not certain. He
told me, three months before, that he had been a chemist and
apothecary abroad. I do not remember his being in a hurry to
catch the train and my being not able to get the stopper out.
It is our practice to do it. We usually cover our bottles with
leather. Attended at Aylesbury on the 13th of January, and
recognised the prisoner the next morning in gaol.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness, who was evidently
favourable to the prisoner and in communication with his solicitor,
was directed to three points&mdash;the suitability of prussic acid
to the disease in the legs from which the prisoner suffered; the
effect of porter on the odour of prussic acid when mixed with
it; and the amount that can be produced from apple-pips.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The prisoner,” said the witness, “told me he was suffering
from varicose veins. I judged that he was, from the medicine I
sold him. He rubbed his leg. The prescription now shown me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
would be a good external application for the ulceration produced
by varicose veins.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Parke.</i>&mdash;“What is that?”</p>

<p><i>Kelly.</i>&mdash;“Scheele’s Acid.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“That prescription is in the handwriting of Dr. Addison.
I do not believe that Scheele’s Prussic Acid could be mixed
with a drink and taken by a person and not smelt after death. <i>I
do not think porter would disguise it.</i> I put about twenty drops of
Scheele’s Prussic Acid down the throat of a parrot with a glass
syringe. Three women were present, and the smell was so strong
and suffocating, that it compelled them to leave the room. The
bird was afterwards stuffed. <i>I mixed thirty drops of this acid with
eleven ounces of porter, and found the odour slightly perceptible. I
did not perceive the difference when the froth was on and when there
was none.</i> It is the property of prussic acid to give out a smell
when volatilising. <i>Apple-pips contain prussic acid. I have assisted
at the extracting it from fifteen small apples. The process was a soft-water
bath, diluted sulphuric acid, and sulphate of iron.</i> <span class="smcap">Two Grains
And a Quarter of Cyanide of Silver Were Produced.</span> <i>I did this
under the direction of Dr. Lievesley, a lecturer at the London Hospital.
In this process two sweet almonds were used.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> by <i>Serjeant Byles</i> the witness admitted
that he made this experiment on the 9th of March at
the request of the Prisoner’s solicitor, and that he had never
made this experiment before; that he had been with Mr.
Hughes only about a year and half, and was paid £80 a year,
and that Dr. Lievesley provided the London Pharmacopœia
acid, and the porter. On being shown a leather or paper
covering of a small bottle that had been found in the ashes of
the grate in Mrs. Hart’s house, the witness declared that it
could not be the covering of the bottle that he had put on, as
it was too small for leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF MRS. HART.</p>

<p><i>Sarah Bateman</i> said that she knew Mrs. Hart six years
ago, when employed to nurse the Prisoner’s first wife, who
soon after died. The witness at that time observed that Mrs.
Hart&mdash;then known as Hadler&mdash;was with child, and the
following statement was subsequently made by her when at
tea with Tawell and the witness.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am in the family way, and will vindicate my master in it.
He is going to be married to Sarah Catforth (the present wife),
‘and if it was to get abroad it would make a great difference to
him.’ She seemed much excited, and Tawell begged her not to
excite herself. ‘He was about to be admitted into the Society of
Friends,’ he said, ‘and should not like these things to get abroad.’
She said, ‘He could marry Miss Catforth, and no one, not even
her mother, should know what had become of her.’”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mary Ann Moss</i>, of Crawford Street, Bryanston Square,
with whom Mrs. Hart came to lodge in 1841, when she was
confined of a girl, remembered Tawell frequently visiting her,
as Mrs. Hart said, “to bring her money from her husband.”
From there she removed to a small house on Paddington
Green for the sake of privacy, where Tawell paid regular
visits, and eventually to Salt Hill, at Tawell’s desire. She
represented to this witness that her husband was Tawell’s
son, that Tawell disapproved of the marriage, and that the
girl and a boy of whom she had been subsequently delivered
were his. Mrs. Hart’s mother, Mrs. Hadler, also spoke to
her having not heard of her for several years.</p>

<p>With the proof by a clerk of Barnet’s Bank that Tawell had
drawn a cheque for £14 on the 1st of January, and the identification
of certain letters being in his handwriting, the case
for the prosecution was closed.</p>

<p class="psh">THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>The nature of the defence opened by Mr. Fitzroy Kelly,
in his long and eloquent address to the jury has already been
indicated by his cross-examination of the medical witnesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and was so fully commented on by the learned judge in his
charge to the jury that it is needless to reprint it. On its
conclusion residents at Berkhampstead who had known him
for several years, testified to the good character which he had
borne for kindness, charity, and benevolence, and a Mr.
Richards, of Dover, and a Captain Dillon, who had both known
him abroad&mdash;the latter for nearly thirty years&mdash;gave similar
evidence of his kind, charitable, and hospitable disposition.
On the conclusion of this evidence Baron Parke adjourned the
Court to the next morning, when he gave the following exhaustive
charge to the jury.</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p>After the usual introductory caution to the <i>Jury</i> to be
strictly impartial, <i>Baron Parke</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He would next tell them what the case was, and how it was to
be proved. It was to be proved by circumstantial evidence&mdash;the
only sort of evidence that could be obtained in most cases of a
similar nature. The most atrocious crimes were committed in
secret, but Providence had so ordered it that some traces were
frequently left which were sufficient to lead to the discovery of the
perpetrators. The law, therefore, wisely provided that direct proof
of crime was not absolutely necessary; but on the other hand it
was equally necessary that by circumstantial evidence the case
should be so fully made out as to leave no rational doubt of its
committal. He should, therefore, advise them to lay down the
rule, that they should first consider what had been proved to their
satisfaction, and then whether all those facts were consistent with
the guilt of the prisoner. If they thought that they were consistent
with his guilt&mdash;and there was nothing inconsistent with it
except the prisoner’s previous character&mdash;then they should consider
whether they were inconsistent with his innocence, and they should
remember that the existence of the crime was not inconsistent with
the other parts of the case. Whilst on this part of the case, he should
observe that the counsel for the prisoner had admitted all those
facts, but had asserted that the law required not only that those
facts should be proved, but that it should be shown directly that
the deceased had died from poison, and that a sufficient quantity
of poison to cause death had been found in her stomach. <i>That
was not true of the law.</i> It was not necessary to give direct and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
positive evidence in every step of the case. There was no difference
between direct and circumstantial evidence, if the evidence was
sufficient to satisfy their minds that death had ensued from poison.
It was not necessary to prove what quantity of that poison was
necessary to produce death by the testimony of the person who
had actually seen death produced by it; nor was it necessary to
prove that such a quantity as would destroy life was actually
found in the body. If they were satisfied that the prisoner
administered poison to the deceased, and that she died of it, it
was not necessary to prove what quantity had been administered
to her. The only positive fact which the law required to be proved
was the finding of the body, where such was possible. The body
of the deceased having been found, it was to be considered whether
the prisoner administered poison to her&mdash;whether it had been
administered to her by the prisoner or by herself. The only allegation
that she had done so was that of the prisoner himself, and
if the jury thought the extraordinary story told by him was
worthy of credit, it would agree with the latter mode of accounting
for her death. But if they did not believe it, they had no other
conclusion left than that he had committed the crime imputed to
him.”</p>

<p class="p1">The learned judge then proceeded to comment on the
evidence of Mrs. Ashley, and others, who deposed to the perfect
health and good spirits of the deceased up to a few
minutes of the discovery of her lifeless body, and to the
medical evidence of the perfect state of her internal bodily
organs, leaving no doubt that she had not died from natural
causes. He then went to the evidence of Messrs. Champneys
and Pickering, the surgeons, who, on opening the body of the
deceased on the day following her death smelt the odour of the
prussic acid.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> “There, then,” he said, “was evidence at once
of the presence of prussic acid in the stomach on the day
following a sudden death accompanied by appearances, such as
would be symptomatic of sudden death from that powerful
poison. Mr. Cooper, the chemist, analysed the contents of
the stomach subsequently and obtained a quantity of pure Prussian
blue from it, and before he proceeded further with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
evidence on this point, he would observe, that the jury should
never lose sight of the conduct of the prisoner during the
whole of the proceedings. He then proceeded to comment on
the evidence of the presence of prussic acid in the stomach
immediately after death, and the allegation of the Prisoner’s
counsel, that it was producible from apples, and that it
might have been produced from natural causes in the stomach,
which contained a quantity of apple pulp. He pointed out
that from all the medical evidence, it was proved that, that
acid was contained not in the apple, but in the pip, and that
pips were not found in the pulp in the deceased’s stomach.
It was also proved that prussic acid had been obtained from
the pips themselves only by a process of distillation, and was
not produced by the mere natural process of digestion.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> No
one would die from eating apple pips, although a person
might be killed by the prussic acid obtained from them by a
chemist. Besides, the action of the acid was sudden and
immediate, and the deceased had died in the manner she
would have done after suddenly swallowing some.”</p>

<p>With respect to the evidence regarding the odour of the
acid being perceptible under this or that circumstance, said
the Judge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“All that could be inferred was, that though the perception of
it was a positive proof of its presence, the non-perception was no
proof of its not being present. As to the deceased having died
from water having been poured down her throat, it was quite idle
to attribute it to that. At that moment she was not living:
death had already done its work. With regard to the quantity of
prussic acid requisite to kill a human being, it had been proved
that less than a grain would kill in some cases, as appeared by the
melancholy cases so frequently referred to of the seven epileptic
patients in Paris; and Mr. Cooper had proved that more than a
grain existed in the stomach of the deceased. It was said that the
experiments were not satisfactorily conducted&mdash;that was a question
for the jury.</p>

<p>“In considering the conduct of the prisoner, the jury must
couple it with all the other evidence, in order to judge how far it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
bore out or contradicted the inferences that might be derived from
it. It appeared that on the day in question the prisoner had gone
to the Paddington station of the Great Western Railway and taken
his place for Slough. He had left his great coat at the Jerusalem
coffee-house, and told the waiter that he was going to dine at the
West End of town. That was untrue, and he must have made
that false statement for some object or other. He went down to
Slough at five o’clock, and between six and seven Mrs. Ashley went
round to the deceased’s house, in consequence of the noise she
heard of stifled screaming. She met the prisoner in the garden in
a state of agitation&mdash;so great that he could not undo the latch of
the gate. She opened it for him. As to the observation she made
about fearing that her neighbour was ill, she could not say that
the prisoner heard it, and therefore it went for nothing. Let that
pass. However, after she got in at the door of the deceased’s
house, she turned round and saw the prisoner looking at her, and
such was the effect upon her that she felt alarmed, and closed and
fastened the door. At seven o’clock the prisoner was seen by a
postboy, and he was then making towards the station. At ten
minutes after seven he was at the station. He was next seen
getting into the Eton omnibus, and asking to be set down at
Herschel House. What his intention was in going to Herschel
House does not appear. He was traced back again to the station,
and an alarm having been given, a signal was made by the electric
telegraph, and he was seen to alight from the railway carriage at
Paddington, and was then traced home. When he was taken up
next morning, and told what he was taken for, his answer was,
that he knew no one at Slough. It had been suggested by his
counsel that this was strictly true, as the deceased did not live
exactly at Slough, but a little distance from it. It had also been
suggested that he wished to prevent his wife hearing of his
improper connection. It would be for the jury to say what
degree of weight should be given to these explanations.</p>

<p>“He had told several falsehoods when informed of the nature of
the charge. On the Friday, about one o’clock, the prisoner had
an interview with his legal adviser, and after that, but not until
after that, did he make any attempt at explanation or give any
account of what had taken place; and the account which he then
gave was the extraordinary statement of her self-destruction.
Here, then, the prisoner represented himself as present when the
poison was administered, and as it was found in her stomach, it
was for the jury to say whether the question did not amount to
the simple one, of whether she had destroyed herself or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
prisoner had administered it. If he thought she had been threatening
to poison herself, he should at least have stayed to see what
would be the effect upon her. The jury would next observe, keeping
the prisoner’s story in mind, that no such vial as that described
by him was found in the house. It had been proved by Mr.
Thomas, who had sold him the poison in the morning, that the
prisoner had prussic acid in his possession that day. He (the
judge) did not give much weight to the observation that he would
not have gone back the next day to the same shop for more if he
were conscious of guilt, because in cases of murder, and especially
of murder by poison, it was found that great precautions were
not used. The perpetrators did not at all expect to be found out.
As to the medicinal use alleged to have been made by the prisoner
of the deadly poison, he might have had varicose veins; but at all
events it had been shown that he had poison in his possession&mdash;he
had the means of doing this act on the day it was committed.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Coming then to the question of motive the Judge gave a
brief history of the connection between the prisoner and the
deceased, and, after detailing its commencement, commented
on it as showing her extraordinary affection and devotion to
the prisoner.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“With striking self-devotion,” said Baron Parke, “she had
said, that, in order not to prevent the union of the prisoner with
the lady to whom he was about to be married, she would go out
of the world, and be dead to the world, even to her own mother,
from that day forth; and the jury had heard from that very
mother that from that time she had never heard of her unfortunate
daughter until after her death. She kept her promise. She did
go out of the world, and went from place to place till she went to
reside at Slough. It appeared that there she received from the
prisoner an allowance of £13 a quarter, and on the day in question
it was seen that he was to have taken her her quarterly allowance.
When taken into custody, the sum of £12 10<i>s.</i>, besides silver, was
found in his pocket; and it was proved that he had drawn a
cheque for £14 that morning. From that fact it might be inferred
that he had gone down with a sort of mixed feeling, either of
paying her the money or, if he had the opportunity of accomplishing
his purpose, of poisoning her. But as to motive for destroying
her, it had been suggested that no man would commit such a
dreadful crime for the sake of getting rid of expense. That, he
should say, was not a matter to be easily judged of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>His Lordship then touched upon all the evidence regarding
his alleged pecuniary circumstances, and read the letter from
his wife, in which allusion was made to his anxiety to have
the papers from Sydney. “As to the feeling appeal made
upon that affectionate letter by his counsel, it only proved
that the prisoner had been very kind to and enjoyed the affection
of his wife, which was not at all incompatible with the
commission of the crime with which he stood charged towards
another woman.”</p>

<p>As to the alleged previous attempt to poison the deceased
in September last, the Judge considered that there was no sufficient
proof that he then administered prussic acid to her. It
was, however, remarkable that after drinking porter with the
prisoner on the 30th September, she should have been so ill,
and that after drinking porter with him on the 1st of January
she should have been taken ill and died. The strong facts
against the prisoner, in his opinion, “were his presence at
the woman’s house at the time she died; his declarations
before and after his arrest, and the fact that prussic acid
was found in her stomach.”</p>

<p>The Judge then read over the whole of the material
evidence, and, with the usual caution, left the case in the
hands of the jury. On Mr. Gunning reminding him of the
evidence to the prisoner’s character which had been produced,
Baron Parke said&mdash;“Such evidence was admissible in cases
of this kind, because it went to show the general impression
of the habits and feelings of a person. The prisoner was
reputed to be a kind-hearted, benevolent man. It was admitted
that he had been transported for some offence, the
nature of which they had not been told, but it was said that it
was not one to affect his character for kindness of disposition.”
The Judge then read over the evidence to character,
and left it to the jury to decide in reference to its value to the
prisoner in his present position.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the Judge’s charge, which lasted from
eight in the morning until half-past eleven, the Jury retired,
and in about half an hour returned a verdict of Guilty. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
few impressive sentences, in which he spoke of the hypocrisy
that had characterised the prisoner’s life in the assumption of
the garb of a virtuous, peaceful, benevolent, and religious
body of persons, the Judge passed on him the dread sentence
of the law, which he suffered on the 28th of March. Previously
to his execution Tawell handed a written confession to
the jail chaplain, that he committed the murder for fear that
his wife should discover his connection with the deceased, and
that the previous attempt was not made with prussic acid.
He never imagined that Sarah Hart had spoken of him to her
neighbours, to whom he believed that he was personally
unknown, and so more likely to escape detection.</p>

<p>At the Easter Quarter Sessions of the County, held subsequently
to the execution of Tawell, an ineffectual attempt was
made by a section of the magistrates to compel the jail chaplain
to deliver to the visiting justices this written confession,
which the chaplain refused to hand over, on the ground of its
having been received under the seal of confession, and on the
promise that it should not be published. All that was known
of it rested on the statement of the governor of the prison, and
the general admission of the chaplain that it was a full confession
of the prisoner’s guilt.</p>

<p>A difficult legal question arose, after Tawell’s death, with
reference to his Australian land, which the Crown re-granted
to his widow and family, after its forfeiture by his conviction;
whether this re-grant should prevail over the claims of a previous
purchaser, a retired auctioneer, who had houses on it,
who alleged that he had purchased it for a <i>bonâ fide</i> consideration,
under a sufficient power of attorney, executed
before Tawell’s conviction. “The affixing the seal of the
colony to this grant by Sir W. Denison, created a serious
difference between that governor and his chief minister, Mr.
Cowper. The seal was affixed pursuant to the instructions of
the Secretary of the Colonies, who only acted in the matter
in accordance with the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General
of England. A part of the sworn duty of a colonial
governor is to obey the instructions of the Secretary of State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for the Colonies.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The governor, therefore, sent his private
secretary for the great seal of the colony and himself executed
the new deed. On this being done the owners of the property
found the ground cut from under their feet, and it never came
before the law courts, but it is believed that some compromise
was effected with the family of Tawell, and so the matter
ended.</p></div>

<p class="psh">TRIAL OF GEORGE BALL FOR POISONING HIS
MOTHER WITH PRUSSIC ACID.</p>

<p class="pind"><i>July, 1860</i>, <span class="smcap">Home Circuit, Lewes</span>, <i>before</i> <span class="smcap">Coleridge, Chief Justice</span> <i>of
Common Pleas</i>. <span class="smcap">Barrow</span>, <i>for the Prosecution</i>. <span class="smcap">Serjeant Ballantine</span>
<i>for the Defence</i>.</p>

<p>This case, really of misadventure, is reported, briefly, as
showing the carelessness with which dangerous medicines
may, no doubt most unintentionally, be administered even by
professional men, the culpable ignorance in some of those
chemists who deal in such deadly preparations.</p>

<p>The accused, a medical man, but not in regular practice,
had for some time attended his mother, a very ailing old lady,
and been in the habit of giving her small doses of prussic
acid, as a remedy for violent attacks of vomiting to which she
was subject. On the 11th of July in consequence, he purchased
of a Mr. Moswell, a chemist in Lewes, a drachm of
Scheele’s prussic acid, equal to 60 “minims,” and gave her a
dose of 4 “minims.” The result was favourable, and the old
lady went for a walk. On her return, however, she again
complained, and the accused administered another dose of
prussic acid, evidently from its effects, a deadly quantity, as
she hardly got to her bedroom before she became insensible,
and died almost instantaneously. The accused believed he
had given her only seven drops, the proper quantity to be
given. That he gave her seven drops was not doubted, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that the size of drops differ under circumstances as much as
the strength of Scheele’s preparation of the acid, will be seen
from the following evidence.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Scrate</i>, a surgeon at Lewes (who was sent for by the
accused, found the lady dead and the accused apparently in a
very distressed state of mind), said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I asked what was the matter; and the accused said he had
given her seven drops of prussic acid, and witness replied he must
have given her more.”</p>

<p><i>Chief Justice.</i>&mdash;“Would seven drops be sufficient to cause
death?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Not according to my experience; it was the proper
quantity to be given. The smallest quantity of prussic acid on
record having caused death was of nine-tenths of a grain.”</p>

<p><i>Chief Justice.</i>&mdash;“How many ‘minims’ would a ‘drop’ contain?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“That would depend upon how the drops were obtained
from the bottle. If the cork was partly in, the drop would
be larger than if it was carefully poured from the open neck of
the bottle. Some medical men made use of one method and
some of the other, but it was his practice not to rely on ‘drops,’
but to measure ‘minims.’”</p>

<p><i>To Mr. Barrow.</i>&mdash;“With such a deadly poison as prussic acid
I should say that it was not prudent for any medical man to rely
on ‘drops,’ but to measure ‘minims.’ The proper doses, as marked
on all bottles of Scheele’s strength, to be administered were <i>one</i>,
<i>two</i>, or the largest <i>three</i> ‘minims.’ Scheele’s acid was not uniform
in strength: sometimes it contained <i>four</i>, sometimes <i>five</i>, and
sometimes as much as <i>six</i> per cent.”</p>

<p><i>Chief Justice.</i>&mdash;“Would not that amount to almost the difference
between life and death?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It would make a very great difference certainly.
Taylor and other eminent medical men have recommended that
Scheele’s prussic acid should not be used, on account of the very
great variation of strength. I myself always use that of the
Pharmacopœia. But notwithstanding what has been written upon
the subject by many eminent men, Scheele’s acid is generally used
in the profession.”</p>

<p><i>Chief Justice.</i>&mdash;“Supposing the acid to be of the highest strength
you have mentioned, do you consider seven drops would have been
sufficient to cause death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I don’t believe they would.”</p>

<p><i>To Mr. Barrow.</i>&mdash;“Six per cent. is an exceptional strength, but
I should think that it would take seventeen minims of that
strength to cause death.”</p>

<p><i>Chief Justice.</i>&mdash;“What do you say is the difference between a
‘drop’ and a ‘minim’?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“That would depend on the sort of ‘drop.’ The
prisoner afterwards gave me a bottle which contained prussic acid.
He told me he had given his mother <i>four</i> minims, and 2·5 minims
remained. I did not test the strength of what remained, but had
no doubt the deceased died from the effects of prussic acid.”</p>

<p><i>To Serjeant Ballantine.</i>&mdash;“There was a broken cork in the
bottle when the accused gave it to me. In his opinion ‘seventeen
minims’ was the smallest dose that would destroy life. It was
very easy to destroy life when dropping the liquid from a bottle.
When accused told him he had given seven drops, he understood
that he had given three and a half minims. He had never heard of
any instance in which the strength of Scheele’s acid had exceeded
six per cent.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. C. H. Moswell</i> (chemist in Lewes).&mdash;“On the 11th of July
accused came to his shop and asked for some prussic acid. Gave
him a drachm, which would contain sixty minims. Did not measure
it, but gave what he considered a quarter of the bottle.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Serjeant Ballantine.</i>&mdash;“As you say you really
did not measure it, can you tell us how much prussic acid you
really did give?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I cannot say to a drop. I am sure he had fifty drops.
I consider a ‘drop’ and a ‘minim’ synonymous. I gave him about
the quantity, but when prussic acid is dispensed by a medical
man, he is, of course, careful as to the quantity he uses.”</p>

<p><i>Chief Justice.</i>&mdash;“We have been told that a ‘drop’ contains two
‘minims,’ and this witness says he looks upon them as synonymous.”</p>

<p><i>Serjeant Ballantine.</i>&mdash;“If you were told to give a patient so
many ‘minims,’ should you give him so many ‘drops’?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Certainly not.”</p>

<p><i>Serjeant Ballantine.</i>&mdash;“Can you tell us the strength of the
prussic acid you sold?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I don’t know what the strength was&mdash;I should suppose
about <i>four</i> per cent.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Case for the prosecution closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Chief Justice</i> called the attention of the Jury to the evidence
and observed, that the fact of the cork being broken in
the bottle and defective was certainly an important matter for
their consideration, as it admitted the possibility that the
prussic acid might have escaped from the bottle accidentally,
and then there was an absence of evidence that an excessive
dose had been administered by the accused.</p>

<p>The <i>Jury</i> almost immediately returned a verdict of “Not
Guilty.”</p>

<p>If the estimate of the witness Scrate is taken for the difference
between a drop and a minim, and the second witness,
Moswell, is correct in saying that he gave the accused at least
50 drops, equal to 25 minims, as only 2·5 minims were left in
the bottle, equal to 4¼ drops; in the two doses the accused
must have administered more than 45 drops, equal to 22½
minims. If the cork was not broken in the bottle when the
first dose was administered, the probability is that the dose
then given did not exceed seven drops of the size that would
make them equal to 3½ minims, thus leaving 19 minims for
the second dose. It is to be regretted that the strength of the
prussic acid was not tested.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="psh">NOTE ON TAWELL’S CASE.</p>

<p>In a case of the poisoning at Egglesham, near Glasgow, by
prussic acid, of a young woman, of the name of Agnes Montgomery,
by Peter Walker, a tailor, the symptoms were thus
described by one of the witnesses, as well as the effect of
prussic acid on herself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“After we learnt that the moaning came from Aggie’s room,
we came up, got Clarkson’s key, and went in. (As in Tawell’s
case, the prisoner had left the girl’s room only a few minutes
before.) Aggie was sitting on a chair (in which it was probable
from other evidence that she had been placed by her murderer),
with her head leaning on the table. The body was quite still.
There was a little froth coming out of the <i>wicks</i> of her mouth.
It was a little coloured with blood; and we afterwards found she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had bit her tongue and her lips. She threw back at different
times, as if in distress. Her right hand was very firmly closed.
I loosed the boot of the left foot, and found it was swelled and
quite stiff. About ten minutes after that was another groan: the
breathing was slow, and with great oppression. She sighed six
times before she died. Her skin was getting quite cold after we
got her. I thought there was a little sweat on her face. We got
hot water to bathe her arms. The eyes were large and staring.
She died about three quarters of an hour after we got her. When
we went into her room, I found a sickening smell. I felt in my
nostrils a kind of nipping, and my throat was dry. I felt it
off Aggie the moment I came forward. I know the smell of
almonds, but can’t say it was exactly like that. On the 5th of
November I saw the superintendent of police, and others, and
saw something (it was prussic acid) put into beer. I smelt the
beer; and after some of it was poured on the floor, I recognised
it as the same smell. It affected me in the same way as before in
the nostrils and throat.”&mdash;<i>Evidence of Mrs. M’Donald.</i></p>

<p class="p1">In this case, on a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the exhumed
body, the presence of prussic acid was clearly detected; and
it was proved on the trial that the prisoner had employed a
carrier to get some prussic acid for him, and that the bottle
containing it had been given to him on the day of the murder;
and the fragments of a glass phial were subsequently discovered,
with the key of the girl’s room, at the root of a tree, at
which the prisoner had been seen stopping, as he returned from
going for a doctor. In this case the poison had been most
probably given in beer, as in Tawell’s, a tumbler in which
beer had been being found on the girl’s table.</p>

<p>The fellow, two months afterwards, tried to poison a
Mr. Mason and his wife, with whom he had gone to lodge
in Glasgow, with prussic acid, but happily failed in his
attempt.</p>

<p>He confessed his guilt; and at first gave as his motive
his desire to possess himself of the girl’s money, but subsequently
said he could not tell what possessed him to do it.
“Following so closely on the case of Madeleine Smith, the
probability is that her case had had on him the same effect as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Palmer’s on Dove&mdash;exciting a morbid desire to tamper with
deadly drugs, and that the death of his victim, and the
danger of the others, was as much due to this feeling as the
desire for plunder.” He was discovered to have been transported
for robbery, and to have been guilty of other crimes.
He now confessed that he had murdered a lad, by pushing
him into a quarry hole. He was executed at Paisley, Jan. 14,
1858.&mdash;<i>Annual Register for 1858.</i></p>

<p class="p1">In this country, only Scheele’s, and the British Pharmacopœia
(2 per cent.) acid, are usually met with.</p>

<p>These numbers, however, must be regarded merely as
rough approximations for two reasons; first, on account of
the extreme volatility of the acid&mdash;if loosely stoppered, or
frequently opened, it rapidly loses strength&mdash;second, both the
anhydrous acid and its aqueous solution are decomposed by
light, with formation of a brown matter. This change is supposed
to be retarded by a trace of mineral acid, hence a little
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid is frequently added to the commercial
solution with this object. But the acid may even be
<i>stronger</i> than supposed, as the methods of preparation are
somewhat various, and the one adopted may have been carelessly
carried out. Scheele’s acid is said to be the most
popular among medical men; samples of it obtained from
different large firms and examined by the author showed very
irregular strengths, the lowest being 2, and the highest 8 per
cent. The latter was purchased at the shop of a chemist who
said he had made it himself, and could guarantee it was of
full strength. He had evidently made allowance for deterioration.
Woodman and Tidy found 16 samples sold in one
neighbourhood as B.P. acid to contain 0·6 to 3·2 per cent. of
HCN; others have found 0·25 per cent. not infrequent. It
follows that if, in a poison case, a bottle has been found of a
hydrocyanic preparation of a definite name, or even with a
certain strength or dose marked on it, it will not be safe to
trust to such figures without actually determining the amount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
In Ball’s trial (Lewes, 1860), the judge asked whether this
variation in strength would not make the difference between a
medicinal and a poisonous dose? It would not, as the maximum
medicinal dose, 4 grains, of even the abnormally strong
(8 per cent.) Scheele’s acid mentioned above, would only contain
0·32 grain of anhydrous HCN, and it requires at least
half a grain to cause death, while about 1 grain is the usual
fatal quantity. And a medical man would not even give
the maximum medicinal dose as a beginning, and without
precaution.</p>

<p class="psh">ACIDUM HYDROCYANICUM DILUTUM, PHARMACOPŒIA BRITANNICA.</p>

<p>We shall use the abbreviation “B. P. 2 per cent.” for this
acid, which has the characteristic odour, a sp. gr. of ·997, and
a taste “at first bland and sweet, ultimately pungent and acrid”
(Thomson), “hot and bitter” (Taylor), “cooling, with pungent
bitter aftertaste” (Watts). If pure, it only slightly and
transiently reddens litmus; if other acids have been added to
keep it, it may have a stronger reddening effect. Also, if
pure, it leaves no residue on platinum, and gives no precipitate
with barium chloride, but with silver nitrate it gives an
immediate white curdy precipitate of silver cyanide, not
blackening in daylight as the chloride does, soluble in ammonia,
insoluble in dilute, but soluble in hot concentrated
nitric acid. It dissolves mercuric oxide, giving a mercuric
cyanide which may be obtained in white crystals on evaporation.
The vapour is said to be more deadly than the fluid
acid. The weaker the acid, the more permanent it is. Glycerine
increases its stability (J. Williams); this might be useful
if suspected substances had to be kept a long time.</p>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>&mdash;Hydrocyanic acid itself has never been found
as a natural constituent of the body, although a compound of
cyanogen occurs in the saliva (<i>see</i> Sulphocyanides). Hydrocyanic
acid is not formed during putrefaction, nor by heating
organic substances with chemical reagents at temperatures up
to 212° F., as in testing for poisons. The only way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
it may be generated from animal matter is by heating with
alkalies <i>to a red heat</i>;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> this cannot, of course, happen in the
ordinary process of testing for prussic acid, though it must be
remembered that cyanide might thus be formed in an <i>ash</i>
(by burning), without having been present in the original
substance.</p>

<p>It is rather frequent, however, in the vegetable kingdom, and
consequently in a poisoning case the defence often sets up the
theory that it has been ingested in the food (Tawell’s Trial,
&amp;c.). It is necessary, therefore, to examine in what kind of
food, and to what amount, it may be taken.</p>

<p>Its principal source is the seeds, leaves, and flowers, and
sometimes the bark, of most of the species of the sub-orders
Amygdaleæ and Pomeæ of the natural order Rosaceæ. It
does not occur in them ready-formed. There is a substance
called <i>Amygdalin</i>, a white bitterish crystalline body, which
may be extracted by alcohol from these plants. Amygdalin
when dissolved by itself in water does not produce HCN, and
is probably harmless, but there exists by its side in the plant a
species of ferment called <i>Emulsin</i> or Synaptase, which has
the power, when macerated in water with amygdalin, of breaking
up the latter into glucose (so-called grape-sugar), benzoyl
hydride (oil of bitter almonds), and hydrocyanic acid. In the
plant the amygdalin apparently exists in cells apart from the
emulsin, but by crushing in water, or masticating in the
mouth, the change is very rapidly effected. By long soaking
the same result may happen, as in cherry brandy; here the
diluted spirit dissolves the amygdalin, and the emulsin then
may act. But if, in the stomach, the apple-pips or cherry-stones
should be found <i>whole</i>, it is almost impossible that the
amygdalin should be decomposed, protected as it is by its
horny or stony envelope. Stones and pips, in fact, pass
through the body intact, and are found in the fæces.</p>

<p>Yet as amygdalin and its decomposition may be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mentioned by the defence, the following account may be
useful.</p>

<p>100 parts of amygdalin yield 6 parts HCN.</p>

<p>It has been found in the species of Rosaceæ given below,
generally in fruit, flowers, leaves, sometimes bark, rarely
root.</p>

<p><i>Pyrus</i> malus (apple pips), domesticus (pear).</p>

<p><i>Prunus</i> spinosa (sloe), avium (bird cherry), padus (wild
service), Virginiana or serotina (wild black cherry), capricida,
insititia (bullace), domestica (plum, damson, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><i>Amygdalus</i> communis (almond), Persica (peach), lævis (nectarine).</p>

<p><i>Armeniaca</i> vulgaris (apricot).</p>

<p><i>Cerasus</i> communis (cherry), acida, laurocerasus (cherry-laurel),
Lusitanica (Portugal laurel).</p>

<p><i>Cydonia</i> vulgaris (quince).</p>

<p><i>Sorbus</i> aucuparia (mountain ash), torminalis, hybrida.</p>

<p><i>Cratægus</i> oxyacantha (hawthorn, young branches).</p>

<p><i>Spiræa</i> aruncus, sorbifolia, japonica (not in herbaceous
species).</p>

<p>Hydrocyanic acid, ready formed, has been found in the
roots of the bitter and sweet cassava (Jatropha manihot).</p>

<p>If the poisonous dose of the B. P. (2 per cent.) acid be at
least 30 minims (Royle’s Mat. Med., Dr. Harley, 6th ed.) the
following table shows the amount of some of the above which
is needed.</p>

<p class="p1">(Allen, Comm. Org. Anal.) It is obvious that of fruits an
impossibly large quantity must be eaten to produce any considerable
amount of HCN. In Tawell’s trial, Mr. Cooper,
the analyst, deposed that the seeds from 15 apples gave him
an exceedingly small quantity of Prussian blue. Whereas,
Henry Thomas, a druggist’s assistant, stated that “15 small
apples gave 2¼ grains of silver cyanide” [equal to 0·46, or
nearly ½ a grain, of anhydrous HCN, corresponding to 25
minims of B. P. acid, nearly a poisonous dose!] “This was
done under the direction of a lecturer at the London Hospital.”
A fair sample of the erroneous and bewildering
evidence that is frequently offered in courts of justice.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper also stated “there is a great difference between
bitter and sweet apples; the bitter contain a great deal of
prussic acid, the sweet, I believe, none at all!” This statement
is misleading; no apples <i>contain</i> prussic acid, but all
that I have met with will <i>yield</i> it by maceration, as all contain
amygdalin. The highest class of eating apples, such as
Newtown pippins, Ribstones, and Blenheims, contain only a
minute trace. These have very few pips, 3 to 5 to each apple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
while the bitter varieties, such as “winesours,” have 9 to 13
pips.</p>

<p>In the arts, cyanides are used in photography, dyeing, cleaning
lace and metals, electro-plating, removing silver stains,
&amp;c. Their solutions may cause accidental poisoning, either
by the fumes or by absorption through the skin, especially if
the latter is abraded.</p>

<p>Hydrocyanic acid is also formed (1) in the preparation of
nitrous ether (sweet spirit of nitre), (2) by distilling albumen,
fibrin, casein, or gelatin, with sulphuric acid and bichromate
of potash, or manganese peroxide, (3) by the dry distillation
of albuminous bodies. It is hardly necessary to say that
these formations could not occur in the ordinary methods of
testing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tests: Preliminary.</span>&mdash;It cannot be too strongly insisted
that all operations for the detection of HCN should be carried
out as soon after death as possible, on account of the loss
from volatility, or from secondary changes. (See Sulphocyanides.)</p>

<p>Allen asserts (Commercial Organic Analysis, 1879), that
detection in the body is rarely possible more than twenty-four
hours after death; but Taylor (Med. Juris., 1873, p. 368)
has found it in the stomach twelve days after, saying, however,
that “after the stomach had been exposed a few days
longer, all had disappeared.” In a dog’s stomach he found
it, after twenty-four hours’ exposure, <i>and washing with water</i>.
In a human stomach, success was achieved seven days after
death, where no odour was perceptible; in another case, after
twenty-two days in the stomach, and after two months in the
spleen. It may be found in the stomach, and not in the
tissues; but in most cases it is easily detected, soon after
death, in the blood, organs, &amp;c. The vapour of HCN will
traverse paper, wet or dry bladder, &amp;c., in a few minutes
(Taylor), and few stoppers are close enough to retain it. Hence
care should be taken to shut up the suspected matters at once
in glass bottles <i>accurately stoppered</i>; bad stoppers are worse
than corks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The stomach should be first examined entire, to ascertain
<i>odour</i>, &amp;c., <i>noticing whether alkaline or acid</i>, then cut in
pieces, under distilled water sufficient to cover it, the whole
measured, and one-half (acidulated with tartaric acid, if
alkaline), placed in a capacious retort, and distilled in a
bath of water saturated with salt to raise the boiling point.
The condenser should be well supplied with cold water, the
receiver attached airtight, with a mercury valve (a narrow
glass U-tube, containing mercury), to prevent undue pressure.
A little distilled water, about ½ oz., should be placed in
the receiver. The distillation should be continued till one-third
to one-half of the original liquid has passed over. The
tests may then be applied to the distillate.</p>

<p>Allen recommends us to distil <i>with water alone</i> about one-half.
If there is no result on testing the distillate, continue
with addition of tartaric acid. Finally, add a considerable
excess of moderately dilute sulphuric <i>and</i> hydrochloric acid,
and carry the distillation nearly to dryness. In the last stage
sulpho-, ferro-and ferricyanides and mercuric cyanide are
decomposed, and give HCN. The original should be tested
for ferrocyanide, &amp;c. This seems a process calculated to
give the clearest idea of the form in which the HCN is
present, but is open to the objection that it is protracted, and
may hence cause loss.</p>

<p>Sokoloff. (Chem. Centr., 1876, 603) advises a much more
heroic treatment. “Strongly acidify with sulphuric acid,
and distil over a water bath for <i>two or three days</i>, replenishing
the water as evaporated. The longer the distillation,
the more accurate the result.” He adds, that the muscles
contain the greater part of the HCN. He quotes figures
in support of his results, but I have not found such prolongation
necessary; and we must remember that HCN
is decomposed by heating with moderately strong mineral
acids.</p>

<p>The following modification, proposed by the author, may
be advantageous, as diminishing the risk of loss, and also
effecting concentration:&mdash;Prepare <i>exactly</i> equivalent solutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of silver nitrate, and hydrochloric acid: the silver solution
may contain 17 grammes of silver nitrate, the hydrochloric
solution 3·65 grammes of hydric chloride, per litre. Place
in the receiver 100 cubic centimetres of the silver solution
(= 1·70 gramme silver nitrate) before distillation. This is
allowing large excess, to provide for exceptional quantities of
HCN. If any quantity of HCN be present, the liquid in
the receiver will become milky; if it does not, there cannot
be more than a minute trace. Transfer the distillate and
washings to a retort, provided with a thistle-funnel, and boil
down to one-third of its bulk; then add, through the funnel,
100 cubic centimetres of the hydric chloride solution, which
will precipitate all the silver as chloride, and liberate the
HCN. Distill with the same precautions as before: the first
25 cubic centimetres will contain probably all the HCN.
If doubted, a further quantity may be collected and tested.
The 25 cubic centimetres of distillate may now be subjected
to the following tests, taking care that each portion is
<i>measured</i> before being examined, in order that the idea of
the quantity present may be definite. For instance, in the
Prussian blue, and sulphocyanide tests, the resulting colour
may be imitated by standard solutions: in the silver test, a
standard silver solution should also be used, and thus a
triply-confirmed knowledge of the quantity present may be
attained; and little bottles, containing the results, should be
preserved, to show in the courts of justice.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Odour.</span>&mdash;All tests involving odour are affected seriously
by the remarkable differences between different people as to
their sense of smell. We hear much of “colour-blindness;”
but the analogous olfactory defect has almost escaped remark.
Yet “smell-blindness,” as I have formerly christened it, or
“anozism,” if a Greek word be required, is exceedingly
common, and chemists and medical men are frequently
afflicted with it. I have known an artist, who could not
smell strong ammonia, yet delighted in the odour of new
paint, which he compared to roses. Many laboratory students
can neither smell acetic acid, arseniuretted hydrogen, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cyanogen. An assistant was so fond of sulphuretted hydrogen,
that he was once found insensible beside the apparatus, having
narcotized himself with the gas (he recovered); and many
more such eccentricities. In the case of prussic acid these
diversities are enormous. Some are so sensitive, that the
least trace in a room becomes rapidly unbearable, causing
headache and nausea; others are like photographers, and
can work in a heavily-cyanogened atmosphere. Such
idiosyncrasies become of great importance in evidence; for
example:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Tawell’s trial, Mr. Champneys, surgeon, testified as
follows: “Have no experience in detecting odour of prussic
acid in a human subject. Should think it may be taken
without detection. Should expect it in the mouth and breath,
but there may be exceptions. There was no odour in her
[the deceased’s] breath; but, on opening the body, I was
positive I smelt prussic acid. The other two surgeons could
not smell it.” Afterwards, when the contents of the stomach
were transferred to a jar, neither the three surgeons, nor
Mr. Cooper, the analyst, could perceive the least odour of
prussic acid, even when the contents were boiled. Nor was
it smelt in the blood. Mr. Cooper subsequently stated: “I
have no doubt that prussic acid may exist without being
smelt: absence of smell may arise from dilution, or from its
being covered by the smell of other substances. When I
smell it, it affects spasmodically the back of the throat.
<i>Sometimes it has produced a spasmodic constriction about the
throat without my smelling it.</i>” Here was a well-marked case
of intermittent smell-blindness.</p>

<p>There were also several questions as to whether prussic
acid might have existed in the form of an inodorous salt.
Mr. Champneys further stated that he put ½ drachm of
prussic acid into a tumbler filled with Guinness’s porter, and
the smell was <i>scarcely perceptible</i>. Mr. Norblad, surgeon,
deposed that he mixed 12 grains of prussic acid with a pint
of porter, but could not then smell it. “Some of the porter
dropped on the table, and I did then smell it.” In the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
trial, Henry Thomas, druggist’s assistant, mixed 30 drops of
B.P. prussic acid with 11 oz. of porter, and found the odour
of the acid <i>slightly perceptible</i>; yet, when he was pouring
Scheele’s acid from a bottle, three women had to leave the
room to avoid suffocation!</p>

<p>In a case of suicide by cyanide of potassium (Chem. News,
1861, p. 261), the smell of prussic acid was not perceived by
the surgeon, either immediately after death or at the post-mortem
examination, nor by the analyst until the contents
had been distilled with dilute sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>To help in elucidating this matter I have made some
experiments as to the detection of the odour of prussic acid.
An acid of 2 per cent. strength (B.P.) was used.</p>

<p>1. From a bottle of Guinness’s stout, freshly opened,
3 samples of 1 fluid oz. each were measured. To the first
1 drop of the acid was added, to the second 2 drops, the third
being left untouched. This was done out of my sight in
another room. They were then privately marked by an
assistant, and brought in; when myself and two others, one
of them entirely inexperienced, independently and at once
classified them without hesitation correctly as to the relative
<i>amounts</i> of prussic acid. The odour was so distinct as to
produce, when inhaled, a feeling of oppression, and to <i>quite
overpower the odour of the beer</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">About <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub> of a poisonous dose. Hence if a poisonous dose
were put into a pint and a half of stout, the odour would be
distinct.</p>

<p>2. One drop of the dilute (2 per cent.) acid was added to
6 oz. stout: there resulted a slight but distinct odour of
prussic acid. Hence a poisonous dose in <i>nine pints</i> would
be smelt. Covered by a watch-glass, with a drop of yellow
ammonium sulphide on it, it was warmed; the drop, on
evaporation, gave a distinct red sulphocyanide reaction with
ferric chloride. Exposed to the air for twenty-four hours, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the above samples had lost their odour, and failed to give the
sulphocyanide reaction.</p>

<p>3. Two samples of urine, measuring ½ pint each, were
treated respectively with 1 and 2 drops of B.P. acid (strength
in this case 1·18 per cent. HCN), and a third ½ pint left untouched,
the same precautions being used as with the above
beers. Three independent witnesses again classified them
without difficulty as to relative amounts of the poison. This
is 2 drops of an exceptionally weak acid to the pint.</p>

<p>4. The contents of a human stomach, very fetid from
decomposition, were divided into two portions of about 2 oz.
each: one was left untouched; to the other 1 grain of mercuric
cyanide was added, and then about 5 drops of hydrochloric
acid, and a little zinc dust. The whole was well
stirred, and shut up close. Next day the odour of HCN was
very prominent in the one to which the cyanide had been
added, in spite of the strong original smell of both.</p>

<p>5. I cannot agree with Taylor that either peppermint or
tobacco mask the odour appreciably.</p>

<p>The odour of <i>nitrobenzol</i>, being similar to that of bitter
almonds, might lead to a suspicion of prussic acid without
due caution (Woodman and Tidy).</p>

<p>In putrefying, organic matters often develope ammonium
sulphide, becoming alkaline. The ammonium sulphide would
combine with the HCN to form sulphocyanide of ammonium,
<i>which is inodorous</i>, but, by distillation with acids, gives
HCN. Sulphocyanide, however, could not be produced <i>unless
the original matters were alkaline</i>. In Tawell’s, and most
other trials, the stomach contents were <i>acid</i>, as they always
are naturally from the gastric juice.</p>

<p>Taylor (Med. Jurisprudence, 1873, vol. i., p. 364) mentions
a case where the blood had a strong odour of prussic acid, and
the mucous membrane of the stomach, <i>even after it had been
washed three times with water</i>, also exhaled a strong odour.
In another case (Med. Gaz., vol. xxxvi., p. 104), where
20 grains of Scheele’s acid had been taken with ultimate
recovery, the vomited matters had <i>no odour</i>, “showing that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
if not concealed by other odours, the whole of the acid must
have been absorbed.” Many other instances might be quoted
where nothing was smelt, and yet the tests revealed prussic
acid.</p>

<p>As to the question about the <i>salts</i> of prussic acid, it may
be generally said that all poisonous cyanides would smell in
the stomach, except, perhaps, mercuric cyanide. <i>See</i> “Properties
of the Salts,” p. 73. Possibly the formation of mercuric
cyanide may have accounted for the absence of odour in
some of the above cases, as I do not find that mercury was
tested for, though its compounds are common medicines.
Otherwise it is hardly possible that hydrocyanic poisoning
should have been effected, and the acid be still there, without
its very characteristic odour being perceptible to an observer
with an acute olfactory sense. I have entered at some length
into the question of odour, as much importance has been
attached to it in the trials, and I still consider it as one of
the most delicate and positive of tests.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Silver Test.</span>&mdash;When silver nitrate is added to a solution
containing HCN or a cyanide acidulated with nitric acid,
a white precipitate falls of silver cyanide, soluble in ammonia,
insoluble in dilute, but soluble in hot concentrated nitric
acid, and not blackened by light. This reaction is rendered
quantitative according to Liebig’s volumetric method. The
original solution is made slightly alkaline by potash, and a
standard solution containing 1·7 grammes of silver nitrate per
litre (1 cub. centimetre = ·0017 grm. AgNO<sub>3</sub>) is added until
a permanent white turbidity is produced, seen best over a
sheet of black paper or a black book. Then each cub. centimetre
used is equivalent to a <i>double</i> quantity or ·00054
grammes of HCN. Formic acid, or chlorides, do not interfere;
in fact, it is advantageous to have a little chloride
present.</p>

<p>The silver cyanide may be also estimated <i>gravimetrically</i>
by adding excess of silver nitrate, collecting the precipitate
on a weighed filter, washing, drying, and weighing. Silver
cyanide corresponds to two-tenths of its weight of HCN<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
(134 gives 27). If chlorides be present, the mixed precipitate
of silver cyanide and chloride is weighed, treated with
dilute hydrochloric acid, and weighed again. The HCN is
thus displaced, and passes into the filtrate; the silver precipitate,
now all as chloride, is weighed again: then the increase
of weight multiplied by 27 and divided by 9·5 (the
difference between the equivalent weights of silver chloride
and cyanide) is equal to the <i>weight</i> of HCN present. But
the volumetric process is quite as accurate, and more expeditious.</p>

<p>In poisoning cases advantage is taken of the opacity of
silver cyanide thus: A drop of moderately dilute silver
nitrate is placed on a watch-glass over the substance, which
may be gently warmed, taking care that the steam condensed
does not cause the drop to fall. If HCN be present, the drop
will become opaque-white from formation of silver cyanide.
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> grain of HCN, equal to ¼ grain of B.P. acid, will give
this reaction (Taylor). If there is only a small amount, and
the action is gradual, the drop on drying in the air may exhibit
crystals of silver cyanide, recognizable under the microscope
as minute prisms obliquely truncated. Of course the
silver nitrate itself may give crystals, but they will be very
soluble in water.</p>

<p>Cyanide of silver is decomposed by (1) hydrochloric acid,
giving silver chloride; (2) dilute sulphuric acid and zinc,
giving silver; (3) sulphuretted hydrogen, giving silver sulphide;
in each case HCN is liberated and may be distilled
off: then the other tests may be applied.</p>

<p>If sulphuretted hydrogen be present, it will give a <i>black</i>
with silver nitrate. The liquid should in this case be previously
shaken with just enough carbonate of lead to remove
the sulphuretted hydrogen. The latter, however, does not
interfere with the Prussian blue or sulphur tests.</p>

<p>When sufficient in quantity, the cyanide of silver, thoroughly
dried in a water-bath, may be transferred to a small
bulb-tube and heated, the end being closed with the finger.
It breaks up into cyanogen gas, silver, and paracyanide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
silver, a peculiar glow and effervescence occurring as it decomposes.
The cyanogen will have the characteristic bitter
almond odour, and, on removing the finger, will burn with a
flame violet on the margin and rosy in the centre.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Prussian Blue</span> (Scheele).&mdash;Add to the solution or
distillate caustic potash in excess, then a drop or two of fresh
ferrous sulphate (protosulphate of iron), and a little ferric
chloride (perchloride of iron&mdash;the tinct. ferri perchlor. of the
Pharmacopœia will do), warm gently for a few minutes, add
dilute hydrochloric acid in slight excess: if much HCN be
present, a deep blue precipitate (Prussian blue) will remain;
if only a trace, the liquid will be greenish, and on standing
till the next day a blue deposit will form.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This is the only
<i>blue</i> iron precipitate which is insoluble in dilute hydrochloric
acid.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Sulphuretted hydrogen does not interfere with
this test, as the black ferrous sulphide dissolves in hydrochloric
acid. The amount of iron salts added should have
some relation to the amount of HCN present, an idea of
which will have been attained by the silver test. Moderate
excess of potash must be present all the time till the hydrochloric
acid is added. A large amount of iron salt is objectionable,
as the yellow colour interferes with the final green
tint with traces of HCN. The test may be made quantitative
by imitating the tint with a weak standard solution of potassium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
ferrocyanide treated with a drop of hydrochloric acid
and a drop of ferric chloride, on the same principle as
“<i>Nesslerizing</i>” (see Wanklyn’s Water Analysis). Finally
the precipitate of Prussian blue should be preserved to exhibit
at the trial, as this is the most positive, though not the most
delicate, test.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Sulphur Test</span> (Liebig).&mdash;The liquid to be examined
is placed in a somewhat shallow glass dish or beaker, covered
almost airtight with a watch-glass, moistened on the under
surface with a drop or two of <i>yellow</i> ammonium sulphide.
[The ordinary sulphide is commonly yellow enough for the
purpose, or, if not, can be made so by warming with a little
flowers of sulphur.] After warming gently for a short time
(the periods recommended by different authorities vary from
half a minute to ten minutes), great care being taken that the
steam does not condense and cause the solution on the watch-glass
to drop back into the liquid, the cover is removed, dried
on a water bath to drive off any excess of ammonium sulphide,
treated with a drop or two of water, and a drop of not too acid
ferric chloride free from nitric acid and diluted till nearly free
from colour. If HCN be present, it will have formed sulphocyanide
with the ammonium sulphide, and will therefore
generate a blood-red colour with the ferric chloride. If a
colour be produced, continue the addition of ferric chloride
till no further deepening occurs. The reaction is made
quantitative by comparing the tint with that produced by a
known quantity of sulphocyanide and ferric solution (Herapath).
But there are difficulties in making it exact.</p>

<p>This is the most delicate test for HCN, detecting <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7930th</sub> of
a grain of HCN in a very dilute liquid, whereas Prussian blue
does not discover less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>780th</sub> of a grain (Taylor, Ann.
Ch. Pharm. lxv., 263). Salts of acetic, formic, and meconic
acids give red colours with ferric chloride, but (1) meconic
acid is not volatile; (2) the red from acetic and formic acids
is at once removed by a slight excess of dilute hydrochloric
acid, sulphocyanide is not; (3) sulphocyanide-red is destroyed
by solution of mercuric chloride, the others are not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The above tests are sufficient, but the following additional
ones have been at different times proposed.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Guaiacum Test.</span>&mdash;Paper dipped in fresh tincture of
guaiacum, containing about 3 per cent. of the resin, then
dried, then moistened with dilute cupric sulphate solution
(2 per cent.), becomes blue in HCN vapour. But the same
effect is produced <i>without HCN</i> by almost all oxydants, such
as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, ferric chloride, nitric and
nitrous acids, chromic acid, peroxide of hydrogen, ozone
(Mohr’s Toxicologie), also by ammonia, hypochlorous acid,
soluble chromates, &amp;c. (Blyth).</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Uranium Test.</span>&mdash;A grain or two of pure ferrous salt
(ammonio-ferrous sulphate will do), and the same quantity of
uranium nitrate, are dissolved in half an ounce of water.
Two or three drops of this are placed on a white plate, and a
drop of the suspected liquid added. A purple precipitate, or
a greyish purple colour in weak solutions, indicates HCN.
Cobalt nitrate may be used instead of the uranium salt, and
is nearly as delicate. (Carey Lea, American J. of Science
[3] ix., 121.)</p>

<p>VII. A hot solution of potassium cyanide mixed with <i>picric
acid</i> gives a deep blood-red &mdash;“picrocyanic” acid). Free
HCN does not give this reaction, and therefore must first be
neutralized by an alkali. Said to be more delicate than the
iron tests. (C. D. Braun, Zeitschr. f. anal. Ch. iii., 464.)</p>

<p>VIII. Slightly alkalize the distillate with potash, add a few
drops of <i>cupric sulphate</i>, and afterwards just enough hydrochloric
acid to dissolve the excess of cupric hydrate: white
cuprous cyanide will remain undissolved. “This test will
detect <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20000</sub> of HCN in solution.” (Lassaigne, Ann. de
Chimie, xxvii., 200.) But a similar effect is produced by
hydriodic acid, and potassium iodide might have been administered.</p>

<p>IX. Mix the HCN with excess of alkali, add cobalt chloride
and tartaric acid: on exposure to air a deep brown-red colour
will be produced. (C. D. Braun, loc. cit.).</p>

<p>X. If to a solution of HCN, potash be added in excess, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
then a little very finely pulverised, or precipitated, mercuric
oxide, the latter will dissolve. Mercuric oxide is soluble in
alkaline fluids only in presence of HCN. (Fresenius, Qual.
Anal.).</p>

<p>XI. “With peroxide of hydrogen, natural blood gives
effervescence from escape of oxygen, but no discoloration.
Blood containing HCN gives a brown colour, the spectroscopic
bands disappearing, and no effervescence.” (Schönbein.)
Hæmatocrystallin, the colouring matter of the blood corpuscles,
combines, in fact, with HCN, giving a dark coloured
compound which appears to be crystallizable and definite in
composition (Hoppe Seyler), does not act as a carrier of
oxygen like the natural hæmatocrystallin, and possesses a
distinct spectrum (see Thudichum, Chem. Physiology). The
blue masses in the blood described by Ralph (Journ. Microsc.
Science, Oct. 24, 1866) have not been found by others.</p>

<p>XII. Mercurous nitrate gives at once with HCN solutions,
a black deposit of metallic mercury, and a solution of mercuric
cyanide. With calomel, a similar reaction takes place according
to Allen, but I have found that the solution is not
deodorized even by large excess of calomel, the odour becoming
stronger and more pungent than the original HCN. On
evaporating, mercuric chloride is left. Probably some cyanogen
chloride is formed. The odour is so much intensified that it
might be of use as a test. In view of the possible administration
of calomel, the reaction is interesting.</p>

<p>Of course it will not be necessary to employ all these
methods. The odour, and the silver, Prussian blue, and
“sulphur” tests will be sufficient. I would suggest a form
of apparatus by which all the latter could be obtained from
the original substance without distillation in a retort.</p>

<p>A shallow beaker or glass jar is closed by an india-rubber
stopper, through two holes in which are passed glass rods
ending in glass spoon bowls bent at right angles, so as to be
horizontal when mounted. The bowls should be one inch in
diameter, and will have to be specially made. In the first
bowl a few drops of silver nitrate are placed, in the second a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
little potash. The apparatus is put in a warm place for six
or eight hours, then the two rods are removed, a third rod
substituted, its bowl containing a drop or two of yellow ammonium
sulphide, the other hole plugged, and the apparatus
put back in the warm place for two or three hours more.
The first bowl will have the silver cyanide, the second should
be treated with ferric and ferrous salt and hydrochloric acid
for Prussian blue (<i>vide</i>), the third evaporated and ferric
chloride added for the sulphocyanide test. This arrangement
prevents loss of HCN by volatilization, and also, with a little
care, avoids any danger of the reagent dropping back into the
solution. The three rods cannot safely be placed in together,
as the sulphide vapour would blacken the silver.</p>

<p>For the modifications in testing necessitated by the presence
of mercury, &amp;c., see under the different <i>Salts</i>.</p>

<p class="psh">SALTS.</p>

<p>Hydrocyanic acid combines with bases to form the <i>cyanides</i>,
which may be thus grouped:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">Cyanides of the Alkalies</span> (potassium, sodium, ammonium),
and of the <span class="smcap">Alkaline Earths</span> (barium, strontium,
calcium, magnesium). These are all soluble in water, are
alkaline to test paper, and are decomposed by all acids, even
carbonic, hence they <i>exhale an odour of HCN</i>, and are nearly
as poisonous as prussic acid itself. If they are present, the
stomach contents must be alkaline. The only member of
this group likely to be met with is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potassium Cyanide, KCN</span>. Broken opaque white lumps,
or small crystals, deliquescent, smelling strongly of HCN,
soapy to the feel, often containing much carbonate, and therefore
effervescing with acids, easily fused by heat to a clear
liquid, very soluble in water, less in alcohol. Used for removing
silver stains in the form of “cyanogen soap,” but very
dangerous, as a cut or scratch may cause absorption, and even
the unbroken skin, according to Allen, may absorb enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cause symptoms. Its aqueous solution decomposes spontaneously
into formiate of potassium, ammonia, and a brown
substance. Its taste is bitter and acrid, causing constriction
and a burning heat in the throat. It is very strongly alkaline.
Distilled with dilute acids it gives off all its HCN. It easily
responds to the other tests. In a case of poisoning investigated
by Dr. Bernays, a piece of potassium cyanide was found
in the deceased’s mouth, which was much inflamed by its
acridity. The alkali being strong, and the acid weak, cyanide
of potassium has most of the effects of an alkaline irritant.</p>

<p>The <i>potassium</i> may be found by incinerating a portion of the
substance and testing for it in the ash. Taylor (Med. Jurisprudence)
improperly says that the <i>salt itself</i> (cyanide of
potassium) may be recovered from the organs by incinerating
them in close vessels and treating the ash with water. I have
already mentioned that cyanide would be formed in this way
from the organic matters themselves, even if not originally
present.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Mercuric Cyanide</span>, Hg(CN)<sub>2</sub>. Of all metals mercury
has most affinity for HCN, mercuric oxide decomposing other
cyanides, even Prussian blue, and dissolving readily, as we
have seen, in free HCN, or in alkaline cyanides. Hence if a
compound of mercury have been given medicinally, the prussic
acid will be found in the stomach as mercuric cyanide,
which is easily soluble in water, neutral to test paper, <i>quite
inodorous</i>, and extremely poisonous. It is not officially recognised
in any Pharmacopœia, except the French; has been
occasionally used in medicine instead of mercuric chloride,
which it resembles in action, but has the advantage of not
being incompatible with alkalies and organic matters (Royle’s
Mat. Med., 6th ed.). It crystallizes in anhydrous four-sided
obliquely-truncated white opaque prisms, with a disagreeable
metallic taste, is permanent in the air, easily soluble in water,
less in alcohol. It fails to respond to the silver nitrate (partially)
or Prussian blue tests, and gives the sulphur test with
difficulty. It is decomposed by distillation with hydrochloric
acid, but only ⅔rds of the HCN pass over into the distillate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
unless ammonium chloride be added (Roscoe and Schorlemmer’s
Chemistry). Whenever HCN is looked for, it is safer
to examine also for mercury, and, if found, to add a little
hydrochloric acid and sulphuretted hydrogen to the original
liquid, thereby precipitating mercuric sulphide (black) and
liberating the HCN, which may be distilled off. If, however,
excess of sulphuretted hydrogen has been inadvertently added,
it would blacken silver nitrate, and hence the silver test would
not be available, unless the solution was previously shaken
with lead carbonate to remove the sulphide. But it would
not affect the Prussian blue or sulphur tests, as sulphide of
iron is soluble in hydrochloric acid. Mercuric cyanide also
gives off all its HCN when distilled with iron filings or zinc
dust, sulphuric acid, and water. This seems a better method.</p>

<p>Mercuric cyanide is said to be an irritant poison, and to be
similar in its action to corrosive sublimate. Combination
with mercury seems to mask the physiological action of HCN,
just as it does its chemical action. The medicinal dose
is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16th</sub> grain gradually increased to ½ grain, in pills or solution
(Royle). 10 grains have proved fatal. By heat, when
dry, it is broken up like silver cyanide into mercury and
cyanogen.</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">Cyanides of the Heavy Metals</span>, as zinc, lead, copper,
&amp;c. <i>Silver cyanide</i> has already been described. These
are insoluble in water, inodorous, and probably, while intact,
not poisonous. But they are decomposed by mineral acids,
and, as the gastric juice is acid, they would more or less
readily yield free HCN, with its usual odour and effects. The
influence of the metal has also to be considered.</p>

<p>D. <span class="smcap">Double Cyanides</span>, derived from iron, cobalt, manganese,
chromium, platinum, &amp;c., are inodorous. Those of the
alkalies and alkaline earths are alone soluble. The only
common ones are ferro-and ferricyanide of potassium, the
so-called yellow and red prussiates of potash. They are said
to be merely purgative, not poisonous, but, from the comparative
facility with which they yield HCN by acids, they
cannot be considered safe. Soluble ferrocyanides give, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
pure ferrous sulphate, a white precipitate turning blue in air;
with ferric chloride a precipitate of Prussian blue; with cupric
sulphate a maroon precipitate. Ferricyanide solutions give
with ferrous salts a deep blue precipitate; with ferric salts a
dark-brown coloration. These reactions would be applied to
a filtered portion of the stomach contents. <i>Prussian blue</i> is
ferric ferrocyanide mainly, but varies in composition: it is
supposed to be inert.</p>

<p>Almen states (Chem. Centr. 1872, 439) that potassium
ferrocyanide in solution decomposes at ordinary temperatures,
especially if a little free acid be present, HCN being formed.
Prussian blue only decomposes when warmed to 40° or 50° C.
(therefore not in the body, C. G. S.), “hence the presence of
HCN, if accompanied by ferrocyanide, is not a proof of poisoning.”
But ferrocyanide is not in any Pharmacopœia, and is
not administered medicinally. Yet, to answer a possible
question, a known fraction of the original substance might be
extracted with water, and tested as above. The same observations
apply to ferricyanide.</p>

<p>When ferro-or ferricyanides are distilled with moderately
strong sulphuric acid, a <i>portion</i> of the contained HCN passes
over; in fact, this is the common process for preparing prussic
acid. The iron remains behind in the retort, in combination
with potassium and the rest of the cyanogen. If ferric
hydrate &mdash;“ferri peroxidum humidum”), or ferrous sulphate
and potash, have been administered as antidotes to HCN,
Prussian blue might be formed in the stomach. It would
then show a blue colour, either by itself or on addition of an
acid, and blue particles under the microscope, if in sufficient
quantity. In this case the HCN left in the stomach would
have been rendered innocuous, and the prussic acid which had
actually caused the death would be found free in the blood, &amp;c.
The stomach contents might then show no HCN, either by
odour or distillation, as Prussian blue is inodorous, and not
easily decomposed by dilute acids. With alkalies it turns
brown, giving ferric hydrate and an alkaline ferrocyanide.</p>

<p>Ludwig and Maushner (Chem. Centr. 1881, 43), in a case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of poisoning, discovered a quantity of potassium ferrocyanide
in the body. This was removed by slightly acidulating and
carefully precipitating by ferric chloride. The filtrate, distilled
with tartaric acid, yielded much HCN. The sample of
cyanide of potassium, which had probably caused death, was
afterwards found to contain a large proportion of ferrocyanide.</p>

<p>E. <span class="smcap">Sulphoncyanides</span> (Thiocyanates). Those of the alkalies
and alkaline earths are soluble and colourless; ferric sulphocyanide
is soluble, and intense blood-red (sulphur test); other
sulphocyanides are mostly insoluble. They are all inodorous,
poisonous in moderate quantities, and are not officinal in any
Pharmacopœia. Distilled with acids they break up, HCN
being found in the distillate. It has been mentioned already
that ammonium sulphide, produced by putrefaction, may combine
with any HCN present to form ammonium sulphocyanide;
therefore, if the matters to be examined are alkaline,
and putrefaction has commenced, Allen (Commerc. Org. Anal.,
1879, art. HCN) recommends us to digest with alcohol, filter,
evaporate to dryness on a water bath, redissolve in a little
water, filter again, and test the filtrate with ferric chloride
after just acidulating with hydrochloric acid: the well-known
blood-red colour will result (<i>see</i> “Sulphur Test”). But the
ordinary distillation with tartaric or sulphuric acid would in
this case also detect the HCN, though the <i>whole</i> might not
pass into the distillate.</p>

<p><i>Sulphocyanide of mercury</i> is the toy called “Pharaoh’s
Serpent.” A case of poisoning by it is recorded.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that traces of sulphocyanide are
naturally present in the saliva. If this salt be found, the
question will occur, how much could be accounted for by the
saliva? Carpenter (Princ. of Human Physiol.) quotes Harley
to the effect that the average daily secretion from the salivary
glands is 1 or 2 pounds: other observers have stated that it
varies greatly. The secretion itself is said to contain, in
1000 parts, one part (Frehrichs), or 0·6 part (Jacubowitsch),
or even 0·3 part (Oehl), of potassium sulphocyanide; that is,
4·2 to 7 grains per pound, equivalent to from 1 to 2 grains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
HCN, or 2 to 4 grains if 2 pounds of saliva were secreted.
This would be a serious matter but for the fact that, whether
from decomposition by the gastric juice or otherwise, or from
its passing out of the stomach as it passes in, it is certain
that no such quantity is ever found naturally in the stomach,
not more than a minute trace being ever given by the processes,
unless hydrocyanic acid, in one of its forms, has actually
been administered.</p>

<p><i>Cyanide of cadmium</i>, and some of its double salts, are
sparingly soluble. <i>Double cyanide of silver and potassium</i> is
soluble and crystallizable. It is the salt used in electro-plating,
and, as commonly met with, smells strongly of
potassium cyanide. <i>Zinc-potassium cyanide</i> has been used
medicinally: it occurs in beautiful crystals, inodorous when
dry, but having a faint odour of HCN in solution.</p>

<p>The other cyanides are rare, and their physiological action
is unrecorded. <i>Cyanic acid</i> and cyanates are said not to be
poisonous.</p>

<p><i>Oil of Bitter Almonds.</i>&mdash;The crude oil contains, as we
have seen, 8 to 15 per cent, of HCN. Dissolved in spirit it
forms “essence of almonds,” and is exceedingly poisonous,
having caused thirty-one deaths in four years (Taylor). Two
drachms of the oil has killed a man in seventeen minutes
(<i>Lancet</i>, 1868, p. 447), two ounces caused death immediately.
The odour of almonds is always distinct in the stomach.</p>

<p>The oil can be freed from HCN, but then does not keep so
well, and is much more costly. Its sp. gr. is 1·049; it boils
at 356° F. The crude oil is yellow: with concentrated sulphuric
acid it gives a crimson-red colour, and on diluting a
yellow emulsion. We may estimate the amount of HCN in
it by shaking with water, separating, adding dilute potash to
the aqueous liquid, and testing it with standard silver solution
as described under “Silver Test.” The other tests may also
be used to prove the <i>presence</i> of HCN; the guaiacum and
copper paper being specially convenient.</p>

<p>A case of poisoning by bitter almonds is reported in the
“South Australian Register” for August 6th, 1879. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
female child (whose age is not stated) ate a dozen of them,
freshly taken from the tree, and died in three hours. The
symptoms described are pain, coma, and convulsions.</p>

<p><i>Antidotes</i> to HCN are generally useless since the death is
so sudden. A moderately dilute solution of an alkali, such
as potash, lime or washing soda, along with a little ferrous
sulphate, would render harmless so much of the poison as
was still in the stomach unabsorbed. As already mentioned,
this would cause a little difficulty in the chemical analysis.
<i>Ammonia</i> acts as an antidote by opposing the <i>depressant</i>
action of HCN. <i>Chlorine water</i> has been used: this converts
the HCN into ammonium chloride, carbon monoxide and
dioxide, and a little cyanogen chloride.</p>

<p><i>Medicinal uses.</i>&mdash;Its primary action is on the cerebrospinal
nerves. It is employed externally, largely diluted, to
allay neuralgia and itching of the skin, and to relieve earache
(not more than two drops of B. P. acid at a time)<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>: it must
not come in contact with abrasions, or it might be absorbed
and produce poisoning symptoms. Internally, it allays dyspepsia
and the irritant effects of capsicum, &amp;c. (Royle). Safe
dose internally two to six minims of the B. P. 2 per cent.
acid, suspended if there is any constriction of the throat
(Farquharson’s Therapeutics).</p>

<p><i>Fatal dose.</i>&mdash;Smallest recorded (Med. Gaz. 35, p. 896);
twenty grains of Scheele’s acid, fatal in twenty minutes, equal
to fifty grains of B. P. 2 per cent. acid, equal to one grain of
anhydrous prussic acid. Largest dose with recovery (<i>Lancet</i>,
1854, January 14), <i>one drachm</i> (sixty grains) of Scheele’s acid,
but in this case energetic remedies were at once applied.
Average fatal dose of 2 per cent. acid, thirty minims (Royle’s
Mat. Med., Dr. Harley, 6th ed.).</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;These vary with the dose, &amp;c. A large
quantity kills in two to five minutes, though insensibility
may ensue in a few seconds. But patients may survive for
twenty minutes, or even for an hour; and may continue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
imminent danger for several hours, and yet recover (Guy and
Ferrier, Forens. Med., 1881). Many cases have occurred of
voluntary acts, such as concealing or throwing away the
bottle, having been performed after fatal doses had been
swallowed (<i>Ibid</i>, p. 600). In animals, according to Mr.
Nunneley, there is usually a peculiar plaintive cry, but not in
man, though there may be a call for assistance. Convulsions,
and involuntary evacuation of fæces or urine, may or may not
occur. Large doses kill by cardiac syncope; smaller ones by
paralysis of the respiratory centre, or, if gradual, by impeded
oxidation of the blood (Farquharson’s Therapeutics). Other
symptoms are, dilatation of pupils, muscular prostration, deep
convulsive breathing at long intervals, quick feeble irregular
pulse, spasmodic closure of the jaws and clenching of the
hands (Taylor). Breathing sometimes stertorous (Christison,
Ed. Month. Journal, February, 1850, p. 97. Reg. <i>v.</i> Burroughs,
Cent. Crim. Court, February, 1857). Vomiting occasional,
or foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem appearances.</i>&mdash;Not characteristic (Farquharson;
Guy and Ferrier). Putrefaction not accelerated (Taylor).
The veins contain dark fluid blood: the right side of the
heart is gorged (Harley). There may or may not be congestion
and reddening of stomach and intestines, or of the brain.
On the whole, the appearances are those of asphyxia.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
odour should be sought for in all parts, and <i>as soon as possible</i>
the organs should be shut up in stoppered jars, or well-corked
and sealed bottles, and sent at once for analysis.</p>

<p>The symptoms and post-mortem appearances of poisoning
by <i>Cyanide of Potassium</i> are the same as those of prussic
acid, except that:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Convulsions are more common.</p>

<p>2. Owing to the irritant action of the alkali, the stomach is
reddened.</p>

<p>3. The contents are alkaline.</p>

<p>The fatal dose is less than five grains, but Taylor mentions
a case of recovery after nearly one ounce of the commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cyanide, which may, however, have contained much carbonate.</p>

<p>Hydrocyanic acid is not, in the strict sense, a <i>cumulative</i>
poison; “but doses that exceed the proper medicinal limit
may happen to prove fatal though similar previous ones have appeared
to be harmless, in consequence of a change in the body
itself.” (Guy and Ferrier’s Forensic Medicine, 1881, p. 606.)</p>

<p>In the trial of George Ball for poisoning his mother with
prussic acid, at Lewes, July, 1860 (previously reported),
the question arose as to the difference between <i>minims</i> and
<i>drops</i>. A minim of water is supposed to weigh a grain: if
the fluid is heavier than water, it weighs more than a grain;
if lighter, it weighs less. But a <i>drop</i> is quite an indefinite
quantity: it is affected, not only by the specific gravity, but
by the cohesion of the fluid, by the shape and size of the
vessel, the manner of pouring, and the temperature. I have
made some experiments which show the irregularity. (See
also Woodman and Tidy’s Forensic Medicine, p. 456.)</p>

<p class="p1">Proving that while a drop may be estimated at about 1½ to
2 minims (a good deal more than the usual supposition, the
two terms being often regarded as synonymous), yet the inconstancy
is so great that it is absolutely imperative, in using
powerful medicines, to prescribe exact measurement, and not
such a precarious process as dropping.</p>

<p>As to the period after death during which HCN may be
detected, Allen (Comm. Org. Anal.) asserts that its detection
is rarely possible after more than twenty-four hours. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
astonishing, as Casper separated more than 18 milligrammes
from a body eight days after death; Sokoloff detected it in
hounds sixty days after; Dragendorff after four weeks in a
dog, after eight or ten days in man. Reichardt (Arch.
Pharm. 3, 19, 204) found it in a body two months after
death&mdash;in the organs, but not in the urine. In the Tawell
trial, also, the interval was considerable.</p>

<p>Casper states in his Handbook (vol. iii., illustrative cases
of HCN) that Schauenstein (one of the Prussian official
chemists), twenty-six hours after death, found no HCN in
the stomach, but a considerable amount of <i>formic acid</i>, the
result of its metamorphosis. We know that strong HCN,
exposed to light, decomposes into formate of ammonium,
which, by distillation with a dilute acid, would give formic
acid in the distillate. That such a change should occur so
rapidly in a dilute solution, and in the darkness of the body,
is improbable. It would be well, however, that formic acid
should be looked for in the distillate thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Carefully neutralize a <i>measured portion</i> with pure soda or
potash; evaporate on the water-bath to dryness. The alkaline
formate will be left in white crystals if present, together
with the cyanide, which will not crystallize, but remain as a
deliquescent mass. Dissolve in a little water, and divide into
three equal portions.</p>

<p>(1.) To the first add silver nitrate in slight excess. Cyanide
of silver will precipitate, formate will remain in solution,
if not too concentrated. Filter, if possible. On boiling, if
any blackening happens from reduction of the silver, formic
acid is <i>probably</i> present. <i>Acetic</i> acid does not reduce silver
nitrate.</p>

<p>(2.) To the second add dilute <i>neutral</i> ferric chloride (a
solution of iron-alum answers admirably). A red-brown
colour, removed by a drop of hydrochloric acid, indicates
either acetic or formic acid.</p>

<p>(3.) Evaporate the third portion to dryness, and ignite
gently in a closed crucible. Formate and acetate will be
turned into carbonate, while cyanide will remain unchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
if air be excluded. If then effervescence take place on treating
the residue with a little hydrochloric acid, it is a confirmation
of the presence of formic or acetic acid. The first test
will have revealed which it is.</p>

<p>Many animal substances, when distilled with strong acids,
<i>do</i> give acetic and formic acids, but they do not act thus with
<i>dilute</i> acids. Yet a stomach will usually yield a little acetic
acid from the food having turned sour.</p>

<p>If formic acid be present, it will probably have proceeded
from the decomposition of HCN. Then the reduced silver
obtained in the first test should be weighed, and calculated
into formic acid, and also into hydrocyanic acid (108 parts of
silver = 46 parts formic acid, or 27 parts HCN). The result
may be stated thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hydrocyanic acid actually found,&mdash;&mdash; grains. Formic acid
found,&mdash;&mdash; grains. If this had proceeded from the decomposition
of hydrocyanic acid, it would correspond to an
additional amount of&mdash;&mdash; grains of hydrocyanic acid.”</p>

<p>It is needless to observe that the mere finding of formic
acid would be no proof of the administration of HCN, unless
strong corroborative evidence were at hand.</p>

<p>On the whole, we must always try, and we may often hope,
to find HCN if given, either free, as cyanide, or as sulphocyanide,
even after months have elapsed.</p>

<p class="pch">TRIALS FOR POISONING BY STRYCHNIA. PALMER, DOVE, AND
BARLOW.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> cases are reported in this chapter. (1) That of
William Palmer, for the poisoning of John Parsons Cook, at
Rugeley, in Staffordshire, which, in consequence of the prejudice
existing against him in that county, was transferred by
Act of Parliament to the Central Criminal Court in the City
of London,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and taken before Lord Chief Justice Campbell,
on the 14th, and eleven following days, of May, 1856.
(2) That of William Dove, for the murder of his wife,
Harriet, at Leeds, tried at York, July 16th, 1856, before
Baron Bramwell. (3) That of Silas Barlow, for the murder
of his mistress, Eliza Soper, at Vauxhall, tried at the Central
Criminal Court, November, 1876, before Mr. Justice Denman.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> of these trials is remarkable for the conflict of the
medico-scientific evidence, the most eminent men among our
physicians and analysts being called on either side, and the
most contradictory testimony as to the possibility of detecting
strychnia being given by them. The <i>second</i> trial shows the
dangerous effect of hasty newspaper reports in such cases&mdash;the
murder of his wife by Dove having been clearly suggested
by the popular report to which some of the journals of the day
gave circulation, that Dr. Taylor, the eminent analyst, had
stated, in connection with Palmer’s case, that strychnia could
not be detected by analysis. This case is also interesting
from the nature of the insanity which was set up by the defence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
The <i>last</i> trial, that of Silas Barlow, exposes the
danger of the sale of the “Vermin Killers,” so popular with
all householders, most, if not all, of which contain a large
proportion of strychnia, and thus offer a ready means for
murder or suicide, especially as the purchase of them would
not be attributed to an evil intention. It is but a poor consolation
to know that, when the mischief has been done, the
punishment of the actor can be secured by the skill of the
analyst.</p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Connection between Cook and Palmer.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Cook</i>, having been originally brought up as a solicitor,
on coming into a fortune of from £12,000 to £13,000, abandoned
his profession, and took to the turf, where he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
acquainted with the prisoner, who had for some years kept
racehorses. Originally in good local practice, Palmer had of
late transferred the majority of his patients to a Mr. Thirlby,
who had previously been his assistant, retaining only two or
three more immediately connected with him or his family.
His father, originally a working sawyer, had, by his industry,
gradually risen to be a timber merchant in a large way of
business, and, on his sudden death in 1837, left a fortune of
£70,000. As he died intestate, the eldest son executed a
deed by which each of the children took £7,000, and the remainder
was left to the widow. Of these children, seven in
number, the prisoner was the fourth. As a child he was
known for his amiability and kindness, but also for his shy
and underhand manner, and his partiality for trying experiments
of a cruel nature on animals. “He was just and
generous,” said one of his early friends, “when he grew up,
and he never forgot an old face.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Originally apprenticed to a
firm of druggists in Liverpool, he had to leave them in consequence
of a scandal in money matters; was then put with
Mr. Tylecote, a surgeon, near Rugeley; walked the London
hospitals, living the gay life of so many of that class of
students; passed his examinations; married the illegitimate
daughter of an Indian officer, who left her a small property;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and set up in Rugeley as a surgeon. Of his five children
only the first, a son, was living at the time of his trial, the
others all dying suddenly of convulsions within a few weeks
after their birth. He was an indulgent husband, a kind
father, a regular attendant at church, and apparently a religious
man.</p>

<p>On his marriage, Palmer commenced to live in a handsome
style, keeping his carriage, and soon after began training and
breeding racehorses, and occupying himself on the turf. As
his wife’s fortune was only for her life, in 1854 he insured
her life for £13,000, the premiums on which exceeded the
income he derived from her, further insurances of a greater
amount being declined by other offices. Within nine months
after this, his wife was dead, and the insurance money
received, relieving Palmer from difficulties that were already
pressing on him. Again, within three months after his wife’s
death, Palmer was endeavouring to effect insurances on the
life of his brother Walter, a confirmed drunkard, to the
enormous extent of £80,000. Only one of these policies,
that in the Prince of Wales’ office, was accepted, the other
offices being put on their guard by the hint that “his wife
had died after the first payment of the premium had been
made.” Pressed by his pecuniary difficulties, he then tried
to effect an insurance for £10,000 on the life of one George
Bate, a decayed farmer, whom he employed as a kind of farm
bailiff, and represented as a gentleman and an esquire, with a
famous cellar of wine, but the insurance offices were now
thoroughly awake; a detective was sent to interview the
esquire, whom he found hoeing turnips, and the scheme fell
through.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Since 1854, Palmer had been in the hands of the bill
discounters, and especially of a money-lending attorney in
Mayfair of the name of Pratt, with whom he from time to
time discounted what purported to be the acceptances of his
mother, some of which were renewed on partial payment,
others cleared off by the money received from the insurance
of his wife’s life.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“This,” said the Attorney-General, “brings us to the close of
1854. In the course of that year he effected another insurance in
his brother’s name, but Palmer was the real party, and corresponded
with Mr. Pratt on the subject of effecting it, and the
policy for £13,000 was assigned to Palmer. On the strength of
that policy, which remained in the hands of Pratt, who paid the
first premium out of a bill he discounted for Palmer at 60 per cent.,
they proceeded to discount further bills, this policy being kept as
a collateral security. The bills, in the whole, discounted in the
course of that year, amounted to £12,500&mdash;two in June, which were
held over from month to month to keep them alive&mdash;two of £2000
each in March, 1855, with the proceeds of which Palmer bought
two racehorses, Nettle and Chicken. These bills were renewed
from time to time, and eventually came due in January, 1856.
Another bill for £2000 was discounted in April, 1855, renewed
like the others, and became due on the 25th of October. On the
9th of July another bill for £2000 was discounted, renewed, and
became due on the 12th of January. On the 27th of September
another bill for £1000 was discounted to pay for the renewal of
the bills due and then coming due. So that when the Shrewsbury
races took place in November, 1855, bills were due or rapidly
maturing to the extent of £11,500, every one of which bore the
forged acceptance of the prisoner’s mother. You will therefore
understand the pressure which naturally and necessarily arose
upon him; the pressure of the liabilities for £11,500 which he
had not a shilling in the world to meet, and the still greater
pressure which arose from the consciousness that the moment he
could go on no longer, his mother would be resorted to for payment.
The fact of his having committed these forgeries would be known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and would bring on him the penalty of the law for that crime so
committed. The insurance company having refused to pay the
policy effected on his brother’s life, no assistance could be derived
from that source.”</p>

<p class="p1">Already, in May, 1855, Cook, with whom he had become
intimately acquainted in racing transactions, had lent him his
acceptance for £200 to meet a small claim, and had had to
pay it on Palmer’s default. In August of that year, Palmer
again asked the money-lending attorney of Mayfair to discount
a bill of Cook’s for £500, representing that Cook required the
money. It was, however, declined without further security,
and then Cook assigned two of his racehorses&mdash;Polestar, the
subsequent winner at Shrewsbury, and Sirius&mdash;as a collateral
security, and obtained only £375 in money, and a wine warrant
for £65, the rest being swallowed up in discount and expenses.
This money and warrant Cook never got, Palmer asking Pratt
to send it to the post-office at Doncaster, whence he obtained
it; and as it was made “to order,” and bore a receipt stamp,
Palmer, it was alleged, forged the name “John Parsons Cook,”
and took the cheque and the warrant, and appropriated the
proceeds. That bill would be due on the day of Cook’s death.
In the same month it was that he attempted to effect the
insurance on Bate’s life and failed; and though Cook had, at
Palmer’s request, attested this proposal, which referred to
Palmer as the usual medical attendant, beyond that he had
nothing to do with this attempt.</p>

<p>Such was the desperate position of the prisoner at this
time. It, however, rapidly grew worse. On the 6th of
November a writ for £2000 against Palmer, and another for
the same sum against his mother, were issued, but held over
by Pratt in order that Palmer might make some arrangement.
This he did to the amount of £800, and in consequence, after
allowing for an exorbitant discount, £600 was taken off the
bill, leaving £1400 to be met. The Prince of Wales office
had refused to pay on Walter Palmer’s life, and Mr. Pratt
would not wait any longer. On the 13th of November, Pratt
wrote him that all the bills, £11,500 in amount, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
met&mdash;a letter which Palmer must have received the next
day&mdash;the day after that on which Cook’s horse, Polestar, won at
the Shrewsbury races. After the race, Cook had between £700
and £800 in his pocket from bets paid on the course, and
from the stakes and his other bets would be entitled on the
week after to receive more than a thousand pounds at Tattersal’s.
Before that day Cook was dead, his pocket-book
empty, and his betting-book not to be found.</p>

<p>Cook, though slightly disposed to pulmonary complaints,
was a hale and hearty young man, at the time of his fatal
illness suffering only from debility.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It was only natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that his victory should excite him, and that with some
friends he should celebrate it with two or three bottles of
champagne at the “Raven Hotel” on his return from the
course. He was, however, generally abstemious. He went to
bed with nothing the matter with him, got up the next day
and went on the course as usual. That night his illness
began.</p>

<p>Late on the evening of the 14th of November, a betting agent
of Cook’s, of the name of <i>Fisher</i>, who was staying at the
“Raven,” was invited by Cook to come into the room where he,
Palmer, and one Myatt were, and take some brandy and water.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“They were drinking grog,” says <i>Fisher</i>; “the deceased had
some brandy and water before him. He asked me to sit down, and
I did so. Cook asked the prisoner to have some more brandy
and water, and he said he would not until Cook had drunk
his. Cook then took up his glass, and drank almost all the
liquor that was in it, and, within a minute, he exclaimed, ‘There
is something in it; it burns my throat dreadfully.’ Upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
saying this, Palmer took up the glass, and sipped what remained
in it, and said, ‘There is nothing in it.’ There was a very small
quantity in the glass when the prisoner took it up. At this time
a person of the name of <i>Reid</i> came in, and the prisoner handed the
glass to him, and asked if he thought there was anything in it, and
handed it to me also, and we said there was nothing we could
recognize, as the glass was empty. I said, however, that there
was a strong scent upon it, but I could not detect anything but
brandy. Cook went out of the room, and when he returned he
called me out. I went with him into my sitting-room. He
appeared very ill, and he told me he had been very sick and asked
me to take his money. He said he thought Palmer had been
dosing him. He gave me £700. He did not say what I was to
do with the money. He was very sick again after he had given
me the money, and asked me to go into his bedroom with him.
I did so. Another person named <i>Jones</i> went with us; the deceased
vomited violently in his bedroom in our presence. He was so ill
I recommended him to send for Dr. Gibson, who attended and gave
him some medicine. He was certainly not drunk; there was
nothing about him approaching to drunkenness. He appeared
very ill the next morning, but a good deal better than the previous
night, and I returned him his money.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Gibson</i>, who saw Cook during this attack, confirmed
Fisher’s and Reed’s account, stating that his tongue was perfectly
clean, his pulse good, but his stomach appeared distended,
that he only administered simple remedies. Cook told
him he thought he had been poisoned. He seemed a little
excited, but not drunk. A <i>Mrs. Brooks</i>, who also attends
races, added the following evidence on this incident:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I went to the ‘Raven’ to see Palmer about half-past ten at
night on Wednesday the 15th. I went upstairs, and asked a servant
to tell Palmer that I wished to speak to him. She said he was
there. At the top of the stairs are two passages, one facing, the
other to the left. I turned to the left. I saw Palmer standing by
a small table in the passage. He had a tumbler-glass in his hand
in which there appeared to be a small quantity of water. I did
not see him put anything into it. There was a light between me
and him, and he held it up to the light. He said to me, ‘I will
be with you presently.’ He saw me the moment I got to the top
of the stairs. He stood at the table a minute or two longer with
the glass in his hand, holding it up to the light and shaking it.
The door of a sitting-room was partially open, and he went into it,
taking the glass with him. In two or three minutes he came out
again with the glass. What was in it was still of the colour of
water. He then went into his own sitting-room, and the door was
shut.”</p>

<p class="p1">Some brandy and water, which Palmer afterwards brought
to Mrs. Brooks, proved harmless to her; but she admitted
that on the previous day a great number of the racing men at
Shrewsbury were affected with sickness and purging, and that
there was a talk in the town of the water being poisoned.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
With the return of Cook from Shrewsbury to Rugeley with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Palmer, on the day after this suspicious attack, the summary
of the case ends, it being necessary to detail the subsequent
events in the words of the leading witnesses.</p>

<p class="psh">THE SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 15th of November, Cook returned
from Shrewsbury with Palmer to the “Talbot Arms,” at
Rugeley, an inn situated immediately opposite Palmer’s own
house. He said he had been ill at Shrewsbury, went to bed
early, dined with Palmer the next day, and returned to the
inn at night, apparently none the worse, and quite sober.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the following morning,” said <i>Mills</i>, the chambermaid, “Palmer
came to see him, and asked me for a cup of coffee for him, which I
procured, and I think I gave it to the deceased, and left the room.
I did not see him drink the coffee; but when I went into the room
shortly afterwards, I found it had been vomited in the utensil. I
did not observe a jug of toast-and-water in the bedroom; but a jug
that did not belong to the bedroom was sent down at night, for me
to make some fresh toast-and-water in it. The prisoner was in
deceased’s bedroom four or five times on this day, and I heard him
tell Cook that he would send him over some soup. I afterwards
saw some broth in the kitchen, which I knew had not been made
in the Talbot Arms; and the waitress took this broth to the
deceased’s bedroom. I saw the prisoner after this, and he asked
me if Mr. Cook had had his broth; and the waitress said she had
taken it to him, but he refused to take it, and said that it would
not stay on his stomach. The prisoner then told me to fetch the
broth, as Mr. Cook must have it, and I did so, and left it in
deceased’s bedroom, and shortly afterwards I saw that it had
been vomited. The same evening some barley water was made for
the deceased, and also some arrowroot, but I cannot say whether
they remained on his stomach or not. Mr. Bamford, the doctor,
was called in after this. On the Sunday after the deceased came
to the Talbot Arms, I saw him in his bedroom about eight o’clock
in the morning, and he said he had slept well since twelve o’clock,
and he felt pretty comfortable. A large breakfast cup of broth
was brought from the prisoner’s house between twelve and one
o’clock on the Sunday, and I took it up to the deceased’s bedroom.
I tasted the broth, and very soon afterwards I was sick. I drunk
about two tablespoonfuls. I vomited violently all the afternoon, and
was obliged to go to bed. I was quite well up to the time of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
drinking the broth. I saw the deceased on Sunday evening, and
he seemed in good spirits, and not to be any worse. I saw the
deceased on the Monday morning between seven and eight o’clock,
when I took him a cup of coffee for his breakfast. He did not
vomit the coffee. Palmer had seen him before this, but he did not
come again until ten o’clock at night. The deceased got up about
one o’clock, and he shaved and dressed himself, and appeared a
great deal better, but said that he was exceedingly weak. Ashmall,
the jockey, came to see him on the Monday, and also Mr. Saunders,
the trainer. Soon after one o’clock, the deceased took some arrowroot,
and it remained on his stomach. The deceased went to bed
at four o’clock, and between nine and ten the prisoner went into
his room, and I left him there. Some pills were sent by Dr. Bamford
for the deceased, about eight o’clock, and I took them into his
room, and placed them on the dressing-table, and they were there
when the prisoner went into the room. I went to bed between
ten and eleven, and I was called up about twelve. I then heard
violent screams from the deceased’s bedroom, and upon entering it
<i>I saw the deceased sitting up in bed, and he desired me to fetch the
prisoner directly. I told him he had been sent for, and I then
walked to the bedside and found one of the pillows was upon the
floor. I picked it up and asked Mr. Cook if he would lay his head
down. At this time he was beating the bedclothes apparently in
great agony, and he told me he could not lie down, and he should be
suffocated if he did; and he then, in a loud tone, asked me again to send
for Mr. Palmer. There was a sort of jumping or jerking about his
head and neck and body all this time, and his breathing was very
much affected. He screamed three or four times while I was in the
room, and twice he called out, ‘Murder.’ He asked me to rub one of
his hands, and I found it quite stiff. It was the left hand. The
fingers were all stretched out and there was no motion in them, and
they twitched while I was rubbing the hand.</i> Palmer came into the
room while this was going on, and the deceased recognized him, and
said, ‘Oh, Palmer,’ or ‘Oh, doctor, I shall die.’ The prisoner
replied, ‘Oh, my lad, you won’t;’ and after remaining a minute or
two in the room he told me to stay there, and went out. He returned
in a very few minutes, and he then produced some pills, and
he gave the deceased a draught in a wine-glass, after he had given
him the pills. Cook said that the pills stuck in his throat, and
the prisoner told me to give him some toast-and-water, and I did
so in a teaspoon. <i>His head and body continued jerking, and he seized
the spoon fast between his teeth and seemed to bite it very hard.</i> The
deceased shortly after swallowed the toast-and-water and the pills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and the prisoner then handed him the draught. It had a thick
heavy appearance. The deceased snapped at the glass in the same
way he did at the spoon, and he appeared unable to control himself.
<i>As soon as he had swallowed the draught, he vomited it immediately,
and it appeared to me to smell like opium.</i> The prisoner then
made the remark that he hoped the pills had stayed, and he
searched the utensil in which the deceased had vomited with
a quill, and said that he could not find them; and he told me
to take the utensil away and empty it carefully, and I did so,
but could not see any trace of the pills. After this the deceased
seemed a little more easy. <i>The attack lasted altogether about half
an hour, and during the whole of the time he was quite conscious.</i>
When he was composed he asked the prisoner to feel how his
heart beat; and Palmer went to his bedside, and put his hand
either to his heart, or the side of his face, and he said it was all
right. I left the deceased about three o’clock in the morning,
and at this time the prisoner was sitting in the easy chair, and I
believe he was asleep. About six o’clock the same morning I saw the
deceased again, and he told me that Mr. Palmer had left him about
a quarter past five o’clock. <i>I asked him how he was, and he replied
that he was no worse; and he then asked me if I had ever seen any
one in such agony as he was the night before, and I told him I never
had. He then said he was sure I should never like to see anyone
in such agony again, and I inquired what he thought was the cause.
He replied that it was through some pills that Palmer had given him
about half-past ten. The deceased was quite composed and quiet at
this time, and there was no jerking or convulsion about him, but his
eyes looked very wild.</i> About twelve o’clock the deceased desired me
to send the Boots over to Mr. Palmer to know whether he might
have a cup of coffee. A message was brought back that he might, and
Mr. Palmer would be over immediately. When I took up the coffee
the prisoner was in the room, and I gave him the coffee, and he
tasted it to see that it was not too strong. Mr. Jones came to the
inn about three o’clock, and I saw him in the deceased’s room, and
the prisoner after this told me that Cook had vomited the coffee.
<i>I saw Cook several times after this, and he appeared in very good
spirits, and talked about getting up the next morning, and wished
the barber to be sent for to shave him.</i> I did not see the deceased
later than half-past ten o’clock on the Tuesday night, and the
prisoner was then in his bedroom, and I gave him some toast-and-water
for the deceased, and the prisoner said he did not want
anything more. I sat up in the kitchen on purpose to see how
Mr. Cook went on, and I heard the bell of his room ring violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
about ten minutes before twelve, and went up immediately. <i>I
found the deceased sitting up, and Mr. Jones had his arm round
his shoulders, apparently supporting him.</i> The deceased when he
saw me, told me to fetch Palmer directly. I went over to his
house, and rang the surgery bell, and the prisoner came to the
window almost in an instant, and opened a small casement, and
I told him to come over to Mr. Cook, as he was in much the same
state as he was the night before. He made some reply, and I
returned at once to the ‘Talbot Arms,’ and in a minute or two the
prisoner came into Mr. Cook’s room. The first thing he said was
that he did not think he had ever dressed so quickly before in his
life. At this time Mr. Jones was supporting the deceased. I
went out into the landing about a minute or two, and the prisoner
came out, and I observed to him that Mr. Cook appeared in the
same state as the night before, and he replied, ‘Not so ill by a
fiftieth part.’ He then went to his own house, and returned in a
very short time to the deceased’s bedroom. <i>I then heard the
deceased ask to be turned on his right side</i>, and I then shortly after
heard that he was dead.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination of Elizabeth Mills</i> was mainly directed
to three points&mdash;(1.) The fact of Mr. Cook complaining of
sore throat, but not of difficulty in swallowing, in May, 1855,
when the witness said all that he did was to use a gargle
sent by Dr. Bamford. (2.) Her omission to tell the coroner
that the broth had made her sick; that Cook had said he
became ill on taking the pills sent by Palmer; that he beat
the bedclothes, called “Murder!” and “twitched” when she
rubbed his hands. These omissions the witness accounted
for by the fact that the coroner did not ask her to detail all
the symptoms she saw, but merely required her to answer
such questions as he put. On her depositions being read,
the Attorney-General proposed to call evidence to prove the
negligence and misconduct of the coroner, but the court ruled
that it was inadmissible.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (3.) That the witness had had
several interviews with Cook’s stepfather, Stevens, his
attorney, and the chief constable, before giving evidence&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
defence imputing that they had instructed her in the symptoms.
She denied, however, any such conduct on their part. She
had heard of Dove’s case, but not read it, and Mr. Stevens
had never given her any money. An attempt to injure her
moral character in reference to a man of the name of Dutton
entirely failed, and her evidence remained substantially
uncontradicted.</p>

<p><i>Lavinia Barnes</i>, the waitress at the “Talbot Arms,”
remembered Cook coming there on Monday, the 12th, on his
way to the races, and not complaining of illness, and she saw
him when he returned on Thursday, the 15th, and after he
came from dining at Palmer’s, on the Friday evening, when
he spoke to her, and was sober.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the Saturday,” continued this witness, “I saw him twice.
Some broth was sent over and taken up to him by me. He could
not take it; he was too sick. I carried it down, and put it in the
kitchen. I afterwards saw Palmer, and told him Cook was too
sick to take it; he said he must have it. Elizabeth Mills afterwards
took it up again. Mills was taken ill with violent vomiting
on the Sunday between twelve and one o’clock. She went to bed,
and did not come downstairs till four or five o’clock. I saw some
broth that day in the kitchen; it was in a sick cup, with two
handles, not belonging to the house. I did not see it brought;
it was taken back to Palmer’s. On Monday morning (19th) I
saw Palmer, and he told Mills he was going to London. I saw
Cook during that day. Saunders came to see him, and took him
up some brandy-and-water. I slept that night in the next room
to Cook’s. Palmer came between eight and nine in the evening,
but I did not see if he went up to Cook’s room. (<i>According to
Mills, Palmer had seen Cook in the morning, and saw him again at
ten at night.</i>) About twelve o’clock I was in the kitchen, when
Cook’s bell rang violently. I went upstairs. Cook was very ill,
and asked me to send for Palmer. <i>He screamed out ‘’Murder!’
He exclaimed that he was in violent pain&mdash;that he was suffocating.
His eyes were wild-looking, standing a great way out of his head.
He was beating his bed with his arms. He cried out, ‘Christ, have
mercy on my soul!’ I never saw a person in such a state.</i> Having
called up Mills, I left to send ‘Boots’ for Palmer, who came, and
I again went into Cook’s room. <i>Cook was then more composed.
He said, ‘Oh, doctor, I shall die!’ Palmer replied, ‘Don’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
alarmed, my lad.</i>’ I saw Cook drink a dark mixture out of a
glass, but do not know who gave it him. I both heard and saw
him snap at the glass. He brought up the draught. I left him
between twelve and one, when he was more composed. On Tuesday
he seemed a little better. At night, a little before twelve, the
bell rang again. I was in the kitchen. Mills went upstairs, and
I followed her, and <i>heard Cook screaming</i>, but did not go into the
room. I stood outside the door, and saw Palmer come. He had
been fetched. I said, as he passed me, ‘Mr. Cook is ill again.’
He said, ‘Oh, is he?’ and went into the room. He was dressed
in his usual manner, and wore a black coat and a cap.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> She also
heard him make the observation to Mills before reported. She
went to the room, but came out before Cook died.”</p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>In consequence of his severe illness, the following deposition
of <i>Dr. Bamford</i> (an aged local practitioner) before the coroner
was read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I attended the late Mr. Cook, at the request of William
Palmer, and first saw him about three o’clock on Saturday, the
17th of November, <i>when he was suffering from violent vomiting,
the stomach being in that irritable state, that it would not contain a
teaspoonful of milk. There was perfect moisture of the skin, and he
was quite sensible.</i> I prescribed medicine for him; and Mr. Palmer
went up to my house and waited until I had made it up, and then
took it away. I prescribed a saline draught, to be taken in
an effervescing state. Between seven and eight in the evening
Mr. Palmer again requested me to visit Mr. Cook. <i>The sickness
still continued, everything he took being ejected from his stomach.</i>
I gave him two small pills as an opiate. Palmer took the pills
from my house. I did not accompany, nor do I know what became
of the pills. On the following morning (Sunday) Palmer again
called, and asked me to accompany him. <i>Mr. Cook’s sickness still
continued.</i> I remained about ten minutes. <i>Everything he took that
morning was ejected from his stomach. Everything he threw up was
as clear as water, except some coffee that he had taken.</i> Palmer
had administered some pills before I saw Mr. Cook on Saturday,
which had purged him several times. Between six and seven in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the evening I again visited the deceased, accompanied by Palmer.
<i>The sickness still continued.</i> I went on Monday morning between
eight and nine, and changed his medicine. I sent him a draught,
which relieved his sickness, and gave him ease. I did not see
him again until Tuesday night, when Palmer called for me. <i>I
examined Mr. Cook, in the presence of Mr. Jones and Mr. Palmer,
and I observed a change in him. He was irritable and troubled in
his mind. His pulse was firm, but tremulous, and between 80° and
90°. He threw himself down on the bed, and turned his face away.
He said he would have no more pills, nor take any medicine.</i> After
they had left the room, Palmer asked me to make two more pills,
similar to those on the previous night, which I did, and he then
asked me to write the directions on a slip of paper, and I gave the
pills to Palmer. The effervescing mixture contained 20 grains of
carbonate of potash, 2 drachms of compound tincture of cardamine,
and 2 drachms of simple syrup, together with 15 grains of tartaric
acid for each powder. <i>I never gave Mr. Cook a grain of antimony.</i>
I did not see the preparations after they were taken away. <i>His
skin was moist, and there was not the least fever about him.</i> I
considered death to have been the result of congestion of the
brain, when the <i>post-mortem</i> examination was made, and I do not
see any reason to alter that opinion. Palmer said he was of the
same opinion with respect to the death of the deceased. I never
knew apoplexy produce rigidity of the limbs. Drowsiness is a
prelude to apoplexy. <i>I attribute the sickness on the first two days to
a disordered stomach.</i>” When called in the sixth day of the trial,
after his recovery, the witness said&mdash;speaking of the last visit to
Mr. Cook&mdash;“Having seen Cook, I left the room with Jones and
Palmer: the latter said he rather wished Cook to have his pills
again (I had prepared the same pills on Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday), and he would walk up with me for them. He did so,
and stood by me in the surgery while I prepared them. I had
strychnia in a cupboard in my private room. I put the pills in
a box, and addressed it ‘Night pills, John Parsons Cook, Esq.’
I wrote that direction all four nights. On the Tuesday night
Palmer requested me to put on a direction. After that I did not see
Cook alive. It was, as near as could be, twenty minutes past twelve,
at midnight, when I saw Cook dead. I understood he was alive
when they came for me, and I could not have been more than five
or ten minutes in going up. My house is about two hundred
yards from Palmer. <i>I found the body stretched out, resting on
the heels and the back of the head,
as straight as possible, and stiff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
The arms were extended down each side of the body, and the hands
clenched.</i> I certified it was apoplexy.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. William Henry Jones</i>, a surgeon at Lutterworth, and
intimate friend of Cook’s for the last five years, was written
to by Palmer on the Monday, the 19th, stating that “Cook
was taken ill at Shrewsbury, and obliged to call in a medical
man;” that “<i>since then he had been confined to his bed with
a very serious bilious attack, combined with diarrhœa</i>,” and that
Palmer “thought it advisable that his friend should come
and see him.” Illness prevented this before about half-past
three in the afternoon of Tuesday, the day before Cook died.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“On my arrival at Rugeley,” said the witness, “I went up to
Cook’s room. He said he was very comfortable, but had been very
ill at Shrewsbury. He did not detail the symptoms, but said he
had had to call in a doctor. Palmer came in. I examined Cook
in his presence. <i>He had a natural pulse. I looked at his tongue;
it was clean. I said it was hardly the tongue of a bilious, diarrhœa
attack. Palmer replied, ‘You should have seen it before.’</i> I did
not then prescribe for Cook. In the course of the afternoon I
visited him several times. <i>He changed for the better. His spirits
and pulse both improved. I gave him, at his request, some toast and
water, and he vomited. There was no diarrhœa.</i> The toast and
water was in the room. Mr. Bamford came in the evening, about
7 o’clock, and expressed his opinion that Cook was going on very
satisfactorily. We were talking about what he was to have, and
Cook objected to the pills of the previous night. Palmer was there
all the time. Cook said the pills made him ill. I do not remember
to whom he addressed this observation. We three (Palmer,
Bamford, and myself) went out upon the landing. Palmer proposed
that Mr. Bamford should make up some morphine pills as
before, at the same time requesting me not to mention to Cook
what they contained, as he objected to the morphine so much.
Mr. Bamford agreed to this, and he went away. I went back to
Cook’s room, and Palmer went with me. During the evening I
was several times in Cook’s room. He seemed very comfortable
all the evening. <i>There was no more vomiting nor any diarrhœa, but
there was a natural motion in the bowels. I observed no bilious
symptoms about Cook.</i>”</p>

<p>By <i>Lord Campbell</i>.&mdash;“<i>Did he appear to have recently suffered from
a bilious attack?</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Examination resumed.</i>&mdash;“Palmer and I went to his house about
eight o’clock. I remained there about half-an-hour, and then returned
to Cook. I next saw Palmer in Cook’s room at nearly
eleven o’clock. He had brought with him a box of pills. He
opened the paper on which the direction was written in my presence.
That paper was round the box. He called my attention
to the paper, saying, ‘What an excellent handwriting for an old
man!’ I did not read the direction, but looked at the writing,
which was very good. Palmer proposed to Cook that he should
take the pills. Cook protested very much against it, because they
had made him so ill on the previous night. Palmer repeated the
request several times, and at last Cook complied with it, and took
the pills. <i>The moment he took them he vomited into the utensil.</i>
Palmer and myself (at Palmer’s request) searched in it for the
pills, to see whether they were returned. We found nothing but
toast-and-water. I do not know when Cook had drunk the toast-and-water,
but it was standing by the bedside all the evening.
<i>The vomiting could not have been caused by the contents of the pills,
nor by the act of swallowing. After vomiting Cook laid down and
appeared quiet. Before Palmer came Cook had got up and sat in a
chair. His spirits were very good; he was laughing and joking,
talking of what he should do with himself during the winter.</i> After
he had taken the pills I went downstairs to my supper, and returned
to his room at nearly twelve o’clock. His room was double-bedded,
and it had been arranged that I should sleep in it that
night. I talked to Cook for a few minutes, and then went to bed.
When I last talked to him he was rather sleepy, but quite as well
as he had been during the evening. There was nothing about him
to excite any apprehensions. I had been in bed about ten minutes,
and had not got to sleep, when he suddenly started up in bed, and
called out, ‘Doctor, get up, I am going to be ill! Ring the bell
and send for Palmer.’ I rang the bell. The chambermaid came,
and Cook called out to her, ‘Fetch Mr. Palmer.’ He asked me
to give him something. I declined, and said, ‘Palmer will be
here directly.’ Cook was then sitting up in bed. <i>The room was
rather dark, and I did not observe anything particular in his countenance.
He asked me to rub the back of his neck. I did so. I supported
him with my arm. There was a stiffness about the muscles of
his neck.</i> Palmer soon came in; two or three minutes at the
utmost after the chambermaid went for him. He said, ‘I never
dressed so quickly in my life.’ I did not observe how he was
dressed. <i>He gave Cook two pills, which he told me were ammonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
pills. Cook swallowed them. Directly he did so he uttered loud
screams, threw himself back in the bed, and was dreadfully convulsed.
That could not have been the result of the pills last taken.
He said, ‘Raise me up; I shall be suffocated.’ That was at the
commencement of the convulsions, which lasted five or ten minutes.
The convulsions affected every muscle of the body, and were accompanied
by stiffening of the limbs. I endeavoured to raise Cook with
the assistance of Palmer, but found it quite impossible, owing to the
rigidity of the limbs. When Cook found we could not raise him up,
he asked to be turned over. He was then quite sensible. I turned
him on his side.</i> I listened to the action of the heart. I found it
gradually weakened, and asked Palmer to fetch some spirits of
ammonia, to be used as a stimulant. He went to his house and
fetched a bottle. He was away a very short time. When he returned
the pulsations of the heart were gradually ceasing, and life
was almost extinct. He died very quietly a short time afterwards.</p>

<p>“<i>From the time he called to me to the time of his death there
elapsed about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. He died of
tetanus</i>, which is a spasmodic affection of the muscles of the whole
body. It causes death by stopping the action of the heart. The
sense of suffocation is caused by the contraction of the respiratory
muscles. The room was so dark that I could not observe the
outward appearance of Cook’s body after death. <i>When he threw
himself back in bed he clenched his teeth, and they remained clenched
after his death. When I was rubbing his neck, his head and neck
were unnaturally bent back by the spasmodic action of the muscles.
After his death his body was so twisted or bowed that if I had placed
it upon the back it would have rested on the head and feet.</i>”</p>

<p>By <i>Lord Campbell</i>.&mdash;“<i>When did you first observe the bowing and
twisting?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>When Cook threw himself back on the bed. The jaw
was affected by the spasmodic action.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness was directed to the
previous health of the deceased, and to his fears that he was
still suffering from a former attack of venereal disease, which
Mr. Jones decidedly negatived; to his having been in
pecuniary difficulties from his racing ventures, which the
witness said he was steadily redeeming; to Cook’s objection
to take morphia; to the question whether, when before the
coroner, the witness had used the word “tetanus,” which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was evident from the original depositions had been scratched
out by the clerk, probably from ignorance of its meaning, and
to whether he agreed with Dr. Bamford that Cook had died
in an apoplectic fit, or rather, as the witness at the time
thought, of one of an epileptic character. In <i>re-examination</i>,
he said that “<i>he was satisfied that Cook’s death did not arise
from epilepsy, as in that disease consciousness is lost, but
there is no rigidity or convulsive spasm of the muscles, and the
symptoms quite different. He was equally certain that it did
not arise from apoplexy.</i>” <i>Dr. Savage</i>, of Gloucester Place,
London, who had attended Cook for four years, also negatived
the suggestion that he was suffering from syphilitic symptoms,
or that he had any venereal taint about him. He was timid,
no doubt, about his throat, and had had two small ulcers on
his tongue due to two bad teeth, but by the end of May they
had gradually disappeared, and were quite well.</p>

<p>The woman who laid out the body noticed that “<i>though it
was quite warm, the hands and arms were cold; the body
lying on the back, straight down the bed,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the arms crossed
upon the chest, and the head ‘lying a little turned on one side.’”
She had never seen so stiff a corpse before. “We,” she continued,
“had difficulty in straightening the arms. We could
not keep them straight down to the body. I passed a piece of
tape under the back, and tied it round the wrists, to fasten
the arms down. The right foot turned on one side outwards.
We were obliged to tie both feet together. The eyes were open.
We were a considerable time before we could close them,
because the eyelids were so stiff. The hands were closed, and
were very stiff. I have never known them so stiff as in this
case.</i>” <i>Mr. Stevens</i>, Cook’s stepfather, who saw the body
three days after death, also noted that the right hand was
clenched, and, as he looked across the body, that the left was
clenched in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>What passed between <i>Mr. Stevens</i> and Palmer at their
interview at Rugeley on the Friday after Cook’s death, and
the reasons why he eventually insisted on a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination and a chemical analysis of the corpse, belong
rather to the section relating to the conduct of the prisoner.
It will be sufficient here to note that on the 26th of
November the <i>post-mortem</i> examination was held with the
following results by Dr. Harland, of Stafford, assisted by
Mr. Devonshire, of the London University, and Mr. Newton,
of Rugeley, in the presence of Dr. Bamford, Palmer, and
several other persons.</p>

<p class="psh"><i>POST-MORTEM</i> EXAMINATION.</p>

<p><i>Dr. John Thomas Harland</i>, physician, of Stafford, arrived
at Rugeley at ten in the morning of the 26th, called at
Dr. Bamford’s on his way to the hotel where the examination
was to be conducted, and on his road met Palmer, whom he
had previously known. “I am glad,” said Palmer, “that
you are come to make a <i>post-mortem</i> examination. Someone
might have been sent whom I did not know.” “What is the
case?” replied Harland; “I hear there is a suspicion of
poisoning.” “Oh no,” said Palmer; “<i>he had an epileptic
fit on Monday and Tuesday last, and you will find old disease
in the heart and head</i>.” Such was not the result of the <i>post-mortem</i>.
They “found the body much stiffer than bodies
usually are five or six days after death&mdash;the muscles strongly
contracted and thrown out, and the hands stiff and firmly
closed.” According to a report which Dr. Harland sent to
Mr. Stevens, and which at the suggestion of the judge was
read in full, the various internal organs were perfectly healthy
and natural, as described in detail in the following examination,
subsequent to reading the report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The abdominal viscera were in a perfectly healthy state. They
were taken out of the body. We examined the liver. It was
healthy. The lungs were healthy, but contained a good deal of
blood; not more than would be accounted for by gravitation
after death. We examined the head. The brain was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
healthy. There was no extravasation of blood, and no serum.
There was nothing which, in my judgment, could cause pressure.
The heart was contracted, and contained no blood. That was the
result, not of disease, but of spasmodic action. At the larger end
of the stomach there were numerous small yellowish-white spots,
about the size of mustard seeds. They would not at all account
for death. I doubt whether they would have any effect upon the
health. I think they were mucous follicles. The kidneys were
full of blood which had gravitated there. They had no appearance
of disease. The blood was in a fluid state. That was not usual.
It is found so in some cases of sudden death, which are of rare
occurrence. The lower part of the spinal cord was not very closely
examined. We examined the upper part of that cord. It presented
a perfectly natural appearance. On a subsequent day, I
think the 25th of January, it was thought right to exhume the
body, that the spinal cord might be more carefully examined. I
was present at that examination. The lower part of the spinal
cord was then minutely examined. A report was made of that
examination.”</p>

<p>This report was put in, and was read by the witness. It described
minutely the appearance and condition of the spinal cord
and its envelopes, and concluded with this statement:&mdash;“There is
nothing in the condition of the spinal cord or its envelopes to account
for death; nothing but the most normal and healthy state,
allowance being made for the lapse of time since the death of the
deceased.”</p>

<p><i>Examination resumed.</i>&mdash;“I am still of opinion that there was
nothing in the appearance of the spine to account for the death of
the deceased, and nothing of an unusual kind which might not be
referred to changes after death. When the stomach and intestines
were removed from the body on the occasion of the first examination
they were separately emptied into a jar, and were afterwards
placed in it. Mr. Devonshire and Mr. Newton removed them from
the body. They were the only two who operated. At the time
the prisoner was standing on the right of Mr. Newton. While
Mr. Devonshire was opening the stomach a push was given by
Palmer, which sent Mr. Newton against Mr. Devonshire, and shook
some of the contents of the stomach into the body. I thought a
joke was passing among them, and said, ‘Don’t do that.’”</p>

<p>By <i>Lord Campbell</i>.&mdash;“Might not Palmer have been impelled by
some one outside him?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There was no one who could have impelled him.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What did you observe Palmer do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I saw Mr. Newton and Mr. Devonshire pushed together,
and Palmer was over them. He was smiling at the time.”</p>

<p><i>Examination continued.</i>&mdash;“After this interruption the opening of
the stomach was pursued. The stomach contained about three
ounces of a brownish fluid. There was nothing particular in that.
Palmer was looking on, and said, ‘They won’t hang us yet.’ He
said that to Mr. Bamford in a loud whisper. That remark was
made upon his own observation of the stomach. The stomach
after being emptied, was put into the jar. The intestines were
then examined, but nothing particular was found in them. They
were contracted and very small. The viscera, with their contents,
as taken from the body, were placed in the jar, which was then
covered over with two bladders, which were tied and sealed. I
tied and sealed them. After I had done so I placed the jar upon
the table by the body. Palmer was then moving about the room.
In a few minutes I missed the jar from where I had placed it.
During that time my attention had been withdrawn by the examination.
On missing the jar I called out, ‘Where’s the jar?’ and
Palmer from the other end of the room, said, ‘It is here; I
thought it would be more convenient for you to take away.’
There was a door at the end of the room where he was. He
was within a yard or two of that door, and about twenty-four
feet from the table on which the body was lying.”
(Before making this last statement the witness referred to a plan
of the room which was put in by the Attorney-General.) “The
other door near which Palmer was standing was not the one by
which he entered the room. I called to Palmer, ‘Will you bring
it here?’ I went from the table and met Palmer half-way coming
with the jar. <i>Since I last saw it it had been cut through both
bladders. The cut was hardly an inch long, done with a sharp
instrument.</i> I examined the jar. The edges were quite clean; no
part of the contents could have passed through it. Finding this
cut, I said, ‘Here is a cut! who has done it?’ Palmer, Devonshire,
and Newton, all said they had not done it, and nothing more was
said. When I was about to remove the jar from the room, the
prisoner asked me what I was going to do with it. I said I should
take it to Mr. Frere’s (a neighbouring surgeon). He said, ‘I would
rather you would take it to Stafford than take it there.’ I made
no answer that I remember. On finding the slit, I cut the strings,
and altered the bladder, so that the slits were not over the top.
I took it to Mr. Frere’s, and left it in his hall, tied and sealed.
Afterwards when I went for my carriage, whilst waiting in the yard,
the prisoner came and asked me what would be done with it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I said, ‘Sent either to Birmingham or London for examination.’
When I recovered the jar, I tied each corner separately and resealed
it with my own seal. During the first <i>post-mortem</i> examination,
there were several Rugeley persons present, but, I believe, no one
on behalf of the prisoner. At the second examination there was
some one on behalf of Palmer (<i>Mr. Pemberton</i> and <i>Mr. Bolton</i>).”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, after stating that Palmer’s words,
“they won’t hang us yet,” were addressed to Bamford in a
loud whisper, and afterwards repeated to several persons, and
that his original notes in pencil were destroyed, a more
formal report being written by him on getting home, <i>Dr.
Harland</i> said&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“At the base of the tongue of the deceased I observed some
enlarged mucous follicles; they were not pustules containing
matter, but enlarged mucous follicles of long standing. There
were a good many of them, but I do not suppose that they would
occasion much inconvenience. They might cause some degree of
pain, but it would be slight. I do not believe they were enlarged
glands. I should not say that the deceased’s lungs were diseased,
although they were not in their normal state. The lungs were
full of blood and the heart empty. I had no lens at the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, but I made an examination which was
satisfactory without one. The brain was carefully taken out; the
membranes and external parts were first examined, and thin slices
about a quarter of an inch in thickness were taken off and subjected
to separate examination. I think that by that means we should
have discovered disease if any had existed; and if there had been
any indication of disease I should have examined it more carefully.
<i>I examined the spinal cord as far down as possible, and if there had
been any appearance of disease, I should have opened the canal.
There was no appearance of disease, however. We opened down to
the first vertebra. If we had found a softening of the spinal cord,
I do not think that it would have been sufficient to have caused
Mr. Cook’s death; certainly not. A softening of the spinal
cord would not produce tetanus; it might produce paralysis. I
do not think, as a medical man investigating the cause of death,
that it was necessary carefully to examine the spinal cord. I do
not know who suggested that there should be an examination of the
spinal cord two months after death. There were some appearances
of decomposition when we examined the spinal cord, but I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
think that there was sufficient to interfere with our examination.</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
I examined the body to ascertain if there was any trace of venereal
disease. I did find certain indications of that description, and the
marks of an old excoriation, which was cicatrized over.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“There were no indications
of wounds or sores such as could by possibility produce tetanus.
There was no disease of the lungs to account for death. The heart
was healthy, and its emptiness I attribute to spasmodic action. The
heart being empty, of course death ensued. The convulsive spasmodic
action of the muscles of the body, which was deposed to
yesterday by Mr. Jones, would, in my judgment occasion the
emptiness of the heart. There was nothing whatever in the brain
to indicate the presence of any disease of any sort; but if there had
been, I never heard or read of any disease of the brain ever producing
tetanus. <i>There was no relaxation of the spinal cord which
would account for the symptoms accompanying Mr. Cook’s death as
they have been described. In fact, there was no relaxation of the
spinal cord at all, and there is no disease of the spinal cord with
which I am acquainted which would produce tetanus.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Monckton</i>, a physician at Rugeley, made a separate
examination of the spinal marrow of the deceased on the 28th
of January, when he said that the body was in such a condition
as to enable him to do so satisfactorily, and when had there
been any disease of a normal character on the spine he should
have had no difficulty in discovering it. All that he found
were certain granules, the origin of which it was difficult to
account for, though frequently found in persons of an advanced
age, but which he never knew to occasion sudden death. He
agreed entirely with the evidence of Dr. Harland.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF MEDICAL EXPERTS.</p>

<p>We come next to a remarkable body of evidence given by
men of such eminence in their profession as Mr. Curling,
Dr. Todd, Sir Benjamin Brodie, and others of nearly equal
mark, negativing the idea that had been suggested in the
previous cross-examinations that the death was due to one of
the two forms of true <i>tetanus</i>, and affirming that the symptoms
which had been detailed were those of the action of strychnia.
Not only were these opinions closely questioned in cross-examination,
but as many medical men, several of them of not
less eminence than these witnesses, were subsequently called
for the defence to contradict them; and thus the most extraordinary
conflict of scientific evidence raised that had hitherto
been witnessed in a criminal court. Subsequently, as we
shall see, a similar dispute between the medical giants of the
day was roused in the case of Dr. Smethurst, but with, in the
end, a very different result. In reading the following statements
for the prosecution, it will help to make them more
clear, if it is borne in mind that <i>tetanus</i> is of two kinds&mdash;(1),
<i>Idiopathic</i>, or self-generated, and the other (2), <i>Traumatic</i>,
the result of a wound or a sore; that the former may arise
from exposure to cold or damp, or even from the irritation of
worms in the alimentary canal, but in temperate climates is
by no means a frequent disease; whilst the latter, from the
various accidents to which human beings are liable, is of more
frequent occurrence. Another point to be remembered is,
that it is a moot point in medical practice whether a syphilitic
sore, unless of course of a most aggravated character, will
produce <i>tetanus</i>, and that the difference between the symptoms
and progress of <i>true tetanus</i> and of that due to poison is, in
the opinion of these experts, very marked. <i>Dr. James Blizard
Curling</i>, surgeon to the London Hospital, was first called,
and after describing the two kinds of <i>tetanus</i> and their causes,
and speaking of the very numerous cases of the “traumatic”
kind which he had seen, he thus detailed the symptoms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The disease first manifests itself about the jaws and neck.
Rigidity of the muscles of the abdomen afterwards sets in. A
dragging pain at the pit of the stomach is almost a constant
attendant. In many instances the muscles of the back are
extensively affected. These symptoms, though continuous, are
liable to aggravations into paroxysms. As the disease goes on these
paroxysms become more frequent and more severe. When they
occur the body is drawn backwards; in some instances, though
less frequent, it is bent forward. A difficulty in swallowing is a
very common symptom, and also a difficulty of breathing during
the paroxysms. The disease may, if fatal, end in two ways. The
patient may die somewhat suddenly, from suffocation, owing to the
closure of the opening of the windpipe; or he may be worn out by
the severe and painful spasms, the muscles may relax, and the patient
gradually sink. The disease is generally fatal. <i>The locking of the
jaw is an almost constant symptom attending ‘traumatic tetanus;’
I may say a constant symptom. It is not always marked, but
generally so. It is an early symptom.</i> Another symptom is a
peculiar expression of countenance. I believe this is not peculiar
to ‘<i>traumatic tetanus</i>,’ but my observation is from such cases.
There is a contraction of the eyelids, a raising of the angles of the
mouth, and contraction of the brow. In ‘<i>traumatic tetanus</i>’ the
lower extremities are sometimes affected, and sometimes, but
rarely, the upper ones. When the muscles of the extremities
are affected, the time at which that occurs varies. If there
is no wound in the arms or legs, the extremities are generally not
affected until late in the progress of the disease. <i>I never knew of
tetanus being produced by a sore throat or a chancre. In my opinion
a syphilitic sore would not produce tetanus. I know of no instance in
which one has led to tetanus. I think it a very unlikely cause.</i> The
time within which ‘<i>traumatic tetanus</i>’ causes death varies from
twenty-four hours to two or three days or longer. The shortest
time to my knowledge was eight to ten hours. <i>When once
commenced, the disease is continuous.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did you ever hear of a case in which a man was
attacked one day, had twenty-four hours’ respite, and was then
attacked the next day?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Never. Such a case could not occur.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You have heard Mr. Jones’s account of the death of
the deceased. <i>Were the symptoms there consistent with any forms of
traumatic tetanus?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>No.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“<i>What distinguishes it from such causes?</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>The sudden onset of the disease.</i> In all cases that
have come under my observation the disease was preceded by the
milder symptoms of <i>tetanus</i>, gradually proceeding to the complete
development.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“<i>Were the symptoms described by Mills those of
tetanus?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>No. Not of tetanus of disease.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Assuming tetanus to be synonymous with convulsive
or spasmodic action of the muscles, was there, in that sense,
<i>tetanus</i> on Monday night?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No doubt there was spasmodic action of the muscles,
but not <i>idiopathic</i> or <i>traumatic tetanus</i>, because the sudden onset
of the spasms, and their rapid subsidence, are consistent with
neither of the two forms of <i>tetanus</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is there not <i>hysteric tetanus</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes: it is rather <i>hysteria</i> combined with spasms,
but it is sometimes called <i>hysteric tetanus</i>. I have known no instance
of its proving fatal, or of it occurring to a man. Some
poisons will produce <i>tetanus</i>. Nux vomica, acting through its
poisons, strychnia and brucia, poisons of a cognate character,
produce that effect. I never saw human or animal life destroyed
by strychnia.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In his <i>cross-examination</i>, Mr. Curling admitted that irritation
of the spinal cord, or of the nerves proceeding to it,
might produce <i>tetanus</i>, and the correctness of Dr. Watson’s
statements in his Lectures, that, in four cases out of five, the
disease begins with lockjaw, and that all the symptoms of
tetanic convulsions may arise from very trivial blows; but he
denied that there was any well authenticated instance of
“<i>traumatic tetanus</i>” occurring within a quarter of an hour
after the reception of the injury, or that it was very likely
that the irritation of a syphilitic sore by wet, cold, drink,
mercury, or mental excitement, might lead to <i>tetanic</i>
symptoms.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The irritation,” said Mr. Curling, “which is likely to produce
<i>tetanus</i> is the sore being exposed to friction, to which syphilitic
sores in the throat are not exposed. I should class <i>tetanus</i> arising
from the irritation of a sore as <i>traumatic</i>. Cases very rarely occur
which it is difficult to class as either <i>traumatic</i> or <i>idiopathic</i>. I
should class <i>tetanus</i> arising from irritation of the intestines as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<i>idiopathic</i>. The character of the spasms of epilepsy are not
tetanic.”</p>

<p><i>Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“Not of the spasms; but are not the contractions
of epilepsy sometimes continuous, so that the body may be
twisted into various forms, and remain rigidly in them?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Not continuously.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“For five or ten minutes together?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I think not.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Does it not frequently happen that general convulsions,
no cause or trace of which in the form of disease or lesion is
to be found in the body after death, occur in the most violent and
spastic way so as to exhibit appearances of tetanic convulsions?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No instance of the kind has come under my observation.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree with this opinion of Dr. Copland,
expressed in his <i>Dictionary of Practical Medicine</i>, under the head
of ‘General Convulsions,’ ‘The abnormal contraction of the
muscles is in some cases of the most violent and spastic nature,
and frequently of some continuance, the relaxations being of brief
duration or scarcely observable, and in others nearly or altogether
approaching to tetanic?’”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I would rather speak from my own observation. I
have not observed anything of the kind.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Does it not happen that a patient dies of convulsions,
spasmodic in the sense of their being tumultuous and alternating,
and chronic in the sense of exhibiting continuous rigidity,
yet after death no disease is found?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It does not often happen to adults.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Does it sometimes?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not know, nor have I read of such a case. I
have no hesitation in saying that people may die from <i>tetanus</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
other diseases without the appearance of morbid symptoms after
death.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are not convulsions, not, strictly speaking, tetanic,
constantly preceded by retching, distention of the stomach, flatulence
of the stomach and bowels, and other dyspeptic symptoms?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Such cases do not come under my observation as a
hospital surgeon. I think it is very probable that general convulsions
are accompanied by yelling. I don’t know that they frequently
terminate fatally, and that the proximate cause of death
is spasm of the respiratory muscles, inducing asphyxia.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“These convulsions are
easily distinguished from tetanus, because in them there is an
entire loss of consciousness.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is it one of the characteristic features of <i>tetanus</i>
that the consciousness is not affected?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Todd</i>, for twenty-one years physician to King’s College
Hospital, well known for his lectures on <i>Tetanus</i> and
the diseases of the Nervous System, and who had seen
only two cases of what appeared to him to be <i>idiopathic
tetanus</i>, so rare are they in this country, gave the following
evidence:<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In my opinion the term <i>tetanus</i> ought not to be applied to
disease produced by poisons, but I should call the symptoms
tetanic in order to distinguish the character of the convulsions. I
have observed cases of <i>traumatic tetanus</i>. Except that in all such
cases there is some lesion the symptoms are precisely the same as
those of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>. The disease begins with stiffness about
the jaw. The symptoms gradually develope themselves and extend
to the muscles of the trunk.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“When the disease has begun is there any intermission?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There are remissions, but they are not complete;
only diminutions of the severity of the symptoms, not a total
subsidence. The patient does not express himself as completely
well, quite comfortable. I speak from my own experience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What is the usual period that elapses between the
commencement and the termination of the disease?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The cases may be divided into two classes. Acute
cases will terminate in three or four days, chronic cases will go on
as long as from nineteen to twenty-two or twenty-three days, and
perhaps longer. I do not think that I have known a case in which
death occurred within four days. Cases are reported in which it
occurred in a shorter period. In <i>tetanus</i> the extremities are
affected, but not so much as the trunk. Their affection is a late
symptom. <i>The locking of the jaw is an early one.</i> Sometimes the
convulsions of epilepsy assume somewhat of a tetanic character,
but they are essentially distinct from tetanus. <i>In epilepsy the
patient always loses consciousness.</i> Apoplexy never produces tetanic
convulsions. Perhaps I may be allowed to say that when there is
an effusion of blood upon the brain, and a particular portion of
the brain is involved, the muscles may be thrown into short
tetanic convulsions. In such a case the consciousness would be
destroyed. Having heard described the symptoms attending the
death of the deceased, and the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, <i>I am of
opinion that in this case there was neither apoplexy nor epilepsy</i>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The deposition of Dr. Bamford, before reported, was here
read, his inability to attend from illness having been proved.</p>

<p>The <i>examination</i> of Dr. Todd by the <i>Attorney-General</i> was
then proceeded with as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“Having heard the deposition of Dr. Bamford read, <i>I do not
believe that the deceased died from apoplexy or from epilepsy.
I never knew tetanus arise either from syphilitic sores or from
sore throat.</i> There are poisons which will produce tetanic convulsions.
The principal of these poisons are nux vomica and
those which contain as their active ingredients strychnia and
brucia. I have never seen human life destroyed by strychnia,
but I have seen animals destroyed by it frequently. The poison
is usually given in a largish dose in those cases, so as to put an
end to the sufferings and destroy life as soon as possible. I should
not like to give a human subject a quarter of a grain. I think
that it is not unlikely that half a grain might destroy life; and I
believe that a grain certainly would. I think that half a grain
would kill a cat. The symptoms which would ensue upon the
administration of strychnine when given in solution&mdash;and I believe
that poisons of that nature act more rapidly in a state of solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
than in any other form&mdash;would develope themselves in ten minutes
after it was taken, if the dose was a large one; if not so large, they
might be half an hour or an hour before they appeared. <i>Those
symptoms would be tetanic convulsions of the muscles&mdash;more especially
those of the spine and neck; the head and back would be bent back,
and the trunk would be bowed in a marked manner; the extremities
also would be stiffened and jerked out. The stiffness, once set in,
would never entirely disappear; but fresh paroxysms would set in,
and the jerking would reappear, and death would probably ensue in a
quarter of an hour or so. The difference between tetanus produced by
strychnia and other tetanus is very marked. In the former case the
duration of the symptoms is very short, and instead of being continuous
in their development, they will subside if the dose has not been
strong enough to produce death, and will be renewed in fresh
paroxysms: whereas in other descriptions of tetanus the symptoms
commence in a mild form, and become stronger and more violent as
the disease progresses.</i> The difficulty experienced in breathing is
common alike to <i>tetanus</i> properly so called, and to tetanic convulsions
occasioned by strychnia, arising from the pressure on the
respiratory muscles. I think it is remarkable that the deceased
was able to swallow, and that there was no fixing of the jaw, which
would have been the case with <i>tetanus</i> proper, resulting either from
a wound or from disease. <i>From all the evidence that I have heard,
I think that the symptoms which presented themselves in the case of
Mr. Cook arose from tetanus produced by strychnia.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Grove, Q.C.</i>&mdash;“There are cases sloping
into each other, as it were, of every grade and degree, from mild
convulsions to tetanic spasms. I have published some lectures
upon diseases of the brain, and I adhere to the opinion there expressed,
that the state of a person suffering from <i>tetanus</i> is identical
with that which strychnia is capable of producing. <i>In a
pathological point of view, an examination of the spinal cord shortly
after death, in investigating supposed deaths from strychnia, is important.
The signs of decomposition, however, could be easily distinguished
from the evidence of disease which existed previously to death,
but it would be difficult to distinguish in such a case whether mere
softening resulted from decomposition or from pre-existing disease.</i>
There is nothing in the <i>post-mortem</i> examination that leads me to
think that the deceased died from <i>tetanus</i> proper. <i>I think that
granules upon the spinal cord, such as I have heard described, would
not be likely to cause tetanus.</i> In animals to which strychnia has
been administered I cannot say that I have observed what you call
an intolerance of touch, but by touching them spasms are apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
be excited. That sensibility to touch continues as long as the
operation of the poison continues. I have examined the interior
of animals that have been killed by strychnia, but I have not
observed in such cases that the right side of the heart was usually
full of blood. It is some years since I made such an examination,
but I am able, nevertheless, to speak positively as to the state of
the heart. <i>It is usually empty on both sides.</i> I do not agree with
Dr. Taylor, or other authorities, that, in cases of <i>tetanus</i>, animals
died asphyxiated. If they did, we should invariably have the right
side of the heart full of blood, which is not the case. I think the
term asphyxiated is sometimes very loosely used. I know, from
my reading, <i>that morphia sometimes produces convulsions, but believe
they would be of an epileptic character. I think that the symptoms of
morphia would be longer deferred in making their appearance than
from strychnia</i>, but cannot speak positively on the point. Morphia,
like strychnia, is a vegetable poison. I have not observed in animals
the jaw fixed after the administration of strychnia.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Whatever may be the
true theory as to the emptiness of the heart after strychnia, I
should say that the heart is more ordinarily empty than filled
after <i>tetanus</i>, and more contracted after strychnia, than in ordinary
<i>tetanus</i>. I do not believe that a medical practitioner would have
any difficulty in distinguishing between ordinary convulsions and
tetanic convulsions. I have heard the evidence of the gentlemen
who made the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, and I apprehend that there
was nothing to prevent the discovery of disease in the spinal cord
had any existed previously to death.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Sir Benjamin Brodie’s</i> evidence, which follows, was given
“with great clearness, slowly, audibly, and distinctly,” and
produced a marked effect.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Sir Benjamin Brodie, examined by Mr. James, Q.C.</i>&mdash;“I have been
for many years senior surgeon to St. George’s Hospital, and have
had considerable experience as a surgeon. In the course of my
practice I have had under my care many cases of death from
<i>tetanus</i>. Death from <i>idiopathic tetanus</i> is, according to my experience,
very rare in this country. The ordinary <i>tetanus</i> in this
country is <i>traumatic tetanus</i>. I have heard the symptoms which
accompanied the death of Mr. Cook, and I am of opinion that so
far as there was a general contraction of the muscles they resembled
those of <i>traumatic tetanus</i>; but, as to the course those symptoms
took, they were entirely different. I have attended to the detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
description of the attack suffered by Mr. Cook on the Monday night,
its ceasing on Tuesday, and its renewal on the Tuesday night.
The symptoms of <i>traumatic tetanus</i> always begin, so far as I have
seen, very gradually, the stiffness of the lower jaw being, I believe,
invariably, the symptom first complained of&mdash;at least, so it has
been in my experience. The contraction of the muscles of the
back is always a later symptom&mdash;generally much later. The
muscles of the extremities are affected in a much less degree than
those of the neck and trunk, except in some cases where the injury
has been in a limb, and an early symptom has been spasmodic
contraction of the muscles of that limb. I do not myself recollect
a case of ordinary <i>tetanus</i> in which occurred that contraction in the
muscles of the hand which I understand was stated to have taken
place in this instance. Again, ordinary <i>tetanus</i> rarely runs its
course in less than two or three days, and often is protracted to a
much longer period. I knew one case only in which the disease
was said to have terminated in so short a time as twelve hours;
but probably in that case the early symptoms had been overlooked.
Again, I never knew the symptoms of ordinary <i>tetanus</i> to last for a
few minutes, then subside, and then come on again after twenty-four
hours. I think that these are the principal points of
difference which I perceived between the symptoms of ordinary
<i>tetanus</i> and those which I have heard described in this case.
I have not witnessed tetanic convulsions from strychnia on animal
life. I do not believe that death in the case of Mr. Cook arose from
what we ordinarily call <i>tetanus&mdash;either idiopathic or traumatic.
I never knew tetanus result from sore throat or from a chancre, or
from any other form of syphilitic disease. The symptoms were not the
result either of apoplexy or of epilepsy. Perhaps I had better say at
once that I never saw a case in which the symptoms that I have heard
described here rose from any disease.</i> (Sensation.) <i>When I say that,
of course I refer not to particular symptoms, but to the general course
which the symptoms took.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“I believe I remember one
case in the physician’s ward of St. George’s Hospital, which was
shown to me as a case of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>, but I doubted whether
it was <i>tetanus</i> at all. It was a slight case, and I do not remember
the particulars.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Considering how rare cases of <i>tetanus</i> are, do you
think that the description given by a chambermaid and a provincial
medical man, who had never seen but one case, is sufficient
to enable you to form an opinion as to the nature of the
case?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I must say I thought that the description was very
clearly given.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing that they differed in their description,
which would you rely upon&mdash;the medical man or the chambermaid?”</p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“That is hardly a proper question.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Alderson.</i>&mdash;“It may be a very proper observation for you
to make.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I never knew syphilitic poison
produce tetanic convulsions, except in cases where there was disease
of the bones of the head.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Two other surgeons, <i>Dr. Daniell</i>, late surgeon to the
British Hospital, and <i>Mr. Samuel Solly</i>, of St. Thomas’s
Hospital, confirmed in every respect the views of the previous
medical witnesses, that the circumstances attending Cook’s
death were clearly distinguishable from those attendant on
ordinary <i>tetanus</i>. They relied on the fact that ordinary
<i>tetanus</i> was always progressive, and that it is never intermittent
to the extent witnessed in Cook’s case, and seldom
endured less than from thirty to forty hours. Mr. Solly
alluded to the peculiar grin&mdash;“the <i>risus Sardonicus</i>, as the
first symptom of <i>true tetanus</i>, which is not common to all
convulsions, and which having once seen,” he said, “you
cannot forget.” He distinguished between <i>tetanus</i> with convulsions
and death from epileptic convulsions by the fact that
“the first seldom leaves any trace behind it, whilst the latter
does leave its trace in the shape of a slight effusion of blood
on the brain, and a congestion of the vessels.” The syphilitic
theory was finally overthrown by the testimony of <i>Mr. Henry
Lee</i>, surgeon to the Lock Hospital, which is exclusively
devoted to syphilitic cases. Though he saw there nearly
3000 cases a year, he had never known one resulting in <i>tetanus</i>,
or read of a case of primary or secondary symptoms having
that result.</p>

<p>In addition to these experts, on the sixth day important
evidence was given by <i>Dr. Jackson</i>, who had had twenty-five
years’ experience of <i>tetanus</i> in India, on the difference of the
symptoms observed in the <i>idiopathic</i> and <i>traumatic</i> kinds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the former being much more frequent in India than in other
climates, affording him in his practice as many as forty
cases.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“It is as equally fatal,” said Dr. Jackson, “according to my
experience, as <i>traumatic</i>. It is frequently found, in India, in
children, both natives and Europeans, and generally takes place
the third day after birth. It will also be occasioned by cold in that
climate. In infants there is a more marked symptom of lockjaw in
<i>idiopathic tetanus</i>. In adults there is no difference in the symptoms
from <i>traumatic</i>. I have always seen the <i>idiopathic</i> form preceded
by premonitory symptoms, such as a peculiar expression of the
countenance, stiffness of the muscles of the throat and of the jaw.
The usual period from the attack to death in infants is forty-eight
hours; in adults, when arising from cold, it is of longer duration,
and may continue for many days, going through the same grades
as the <i>traumatic</i> forms.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“The patient always appears
to be very uncomfortable shortly before an attack of <i>idiopathic
tetanus</i>. His appetite would not be affected, but he would chiefly
complain of the muscles of the neck. He might entertain a desire
for food, and take it as usual within twelve hours of the attack.
I never heard a patient complain of want of appetite. Within
the twelve hours I should say that the patient’s attention would
be more directed to the stiffness of his mouth and neck. I have
known cases of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>, where the first paroxysm was in
bed. Difficulty of swallowing is another premonitory symptom.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“In the case of a child
not more than six hours would elapse between the premonitory
symptoms and the tetanic convulsions; in an adult the period
would not be greater than twenty-four hours. The duration of
the disease generally varies from three to ten days, but death has
occurred as early as two days. The <i>traumatic</i> and <i>idiopathic</i> cases
are alike in these respects. Both forms of the disorder are much
more common in India than they are in this country. The
symptoms are not more severe. <i>In all my experience I never saw
a case in which the disease ran its course in twenty minutes.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="psh">LATE EXAMPLES OF DEATH BY STRYCHNIA.</p>

<p>Four cases of undoubted poisoning by strychnia were
brought forward by the prosecution, in each of which the
symptoms had been observed by medical men, as well as by
the attendants on the several patients. In the <i>first</i> case, that
of Agnes Sennett, or French, a patient in the Glasgow Infirmary,
in September, 1845, for a sore skin, from thoughtlessness
apparently, she took one of two strychnia pills
prepared for a paralytic patient, and then went and sat by the
ward fire. “In three quarters of an hour,” said <i>Kelly</i>,
another patient, “she was taken ill and fell back on the floor.
I went for the nurse; we took her to bed, and sent for the
doctor; we were obliged to cut her clothes off first because
she never moved. She was like a poker. She never spoke till
she died.” Each pill, according to the prescription, contained
a quarter of a grain of strychnia. When the medical clerk of
the hospital saw her in bed, the symptoms were&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<i>A strong retraction of the mouth; the face much suffused and
red; the pupils of the eyes dilated; the head bent back; the spine
curved, and the muscles rigid and hard as a board; the arms
stretched out; the hands clinched; and there were severe paroxysms
occurring in about a quarter of an hour. She died in about an hour
and a quarter.</i> When I was called the paroxysms did not last so
long; but they increased in severity.” “<i>The retraction of the mouth
was continuous, but worse at times.</i> I do not think I observed it after
death. <i>The hands were not clinched after death; they were semi-bent.</i>
The symptoms appeared about thirty minutes after taking the
pills. I tried to make her vomit with a feather. She only vomited
partially after I had given her an emetic. <i>There was spasmodic
action and grinding of the teeth. She could open her mouth and
swallow. There was no lockjaw or ordinary tetanus.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Watson</i>, the surgeon to the infirmary, who was called
in within a quarter of an hour of the patient being taken ill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
said, “<i>She was in violent convulsions, and her arms stretched
out and rigid; they were kept quiet by rigidity. She did not
breathe, the muscles being kept still by tetanic rigidity.</i> That
paroxysm subsided, and fresh ones came on after a short
interval. She died in about half an hour. She was perfectly
conscious. Her body was opened. <i>The heart was found
distended and stiff. The cavities of it were empty.</i> The
spinal cord was healthy.”</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> case, also of accidental poisoning, by the error
of a local chemist, who substituted strychnia for salicine
(willow bark), of which there ought to have been nine grains
in the bottle of medicine, was that of a Mrs. Sergeantson
Smyth, residing near Romsey. On the 30th of October, 1848,
she took half a wine-glass of the mixture, equal to a third of
the whole, containing three grains of strychnia. The effect
was of course immediate. The symptoms were identical with
Cook’s.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I left the room,” said <i>Hickson</i>, the lady’s maid, “when I had
given it her. Five or ten minutes afterwards I was alarmed by the
ringing of her bell. I went into her room and found her out of bed
leaning upon a chair in her night-dress. I thought she had fainted.
She appeared to suffer from what I thought were spasms. I ran
and sent the coachman for Dr. Taylor, and returned to her. Some
of the other servants were there assisting her. <i>She was lying on
the floor. She screamed loudly, and her teeth were clinched. She
asked to have her arms and legs held straight. I took hold of them;
they were very much drawn up. She still screamed and was in great
agony. She requested that water should be thrown over her, and I threw
some. I put a bottle of hot water to her feet, but it did not relax
them. Shortly before she died she said she felt easier. The last
words she uttered were, ‘Turn me over.’ She died very quietly. She
was quite conscious, and knew me during the whole time. About
an hour and a quarter after I gave her the medicine she died.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Grove, Q.C.</i>&mdash;“She could not sit up from
the time I went to her till she died. It was when she was in a
paroxysm that I tried to straighten her limbs. The effect of the
cold water was to throw her into a paroxysm. It was a continually
recurring attack, lasting about an hour and a quarter. Her teeth
were clinched the whole time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i>&mdash;“She was stiff all the time till within a few
minutes of her death. She was conscious all the time.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Francis Taylor</i>, of Romsey, found her dead on his
arrival. “Her body was on the floor by the bed; <i>the hands
very much bent; the feet contracted and turned inwards; the
soles of the feet hollowed up and the toes contracted, apparently
from recent spasmodic action; the inner edge of each foot was
turned; there was a remarkable rigidity about the limbs; the
body was warm, and the eyelids almost adherent to the eyeballs.</i>”
Three days afterwards the witness made a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, with the following results:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The contraction of the feet continued, but it had gone off somewhat
from the rest of the body. I found no disease in the body.
<i>The heart was contracted, and perfectly empty</i>, as were all the large
arteries leading from it. I analysed the medicine she had taken
with another medical man. It contained a large quantity of
strychnia. It had originally contained nine grains; she had taken
a third&mdash;three grains. I made a very casual examination of the
stomach and bowels, as we had plenty of proof that poison had
been taken, without the use of tests.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“In cases of death from
ordinary causes the body is much distorted. It does not generally
remain in the same position. If the body is not laid out immediately,
probably it is stiffened by the <i>rigor mortis</i>. The ankles
were tied by a bandage to keep them together. I commenced to
open the body by the thorax and abdomen. The head also was
opened.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>third</i> case was that of a Mr. Clutterbuck, a gentleman
suffering from paralysis, on whom, with <i>Dr. Chambers</i>,
<i>Mr. E. D. Moore</i>, who detailed the case, had attended some
fifteen years before.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“We had been giving him,” said the witness, “small doses of
strychnia, when he went to Brighton. On his return he told us
he had taken larger doses of it, and we in consequence gave him
a stronger dose. I made up three draughts of a quarter of a grain
each. He took one in my presence. I remained with him a little
time, and he said he felt quite comfortable. About three quarters
of an hour afterwards I was summoned to him. <i>I found him stiffened
in every limb, and the head drawn back. He was desirous we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
move him, and turn him and rub him.</i> We tried to give him
ammonia in a spoon, <i>and he snapped at it</i>. He was suffering, I
should say, more than three hours. Sedatives were given to him.
He survived the attack. <i>He was conscious all the time.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“The spasms ceased in
about three hours, but the rigidity of the muscles remained till the
next day. His hands were at first drawn back, and he was much
easier when we got them round clinched together. His paralysis
was better after the attack.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Strychnia stimulates the
nerves which act upon the voluntary muscles, and therefore acts
beneficially in cases of paralysis.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>fourth</i> case of poisoning by strychnia, though at this
time given anonymously, as it had not as yet been brought to
a public trial, was that of Mrs. Dove, of Leeds, more fully
related in the next report. In this case, <i>Mrs. Witham</i>, who
had been in attendance on the deceased, described how, after
taking the medicine given to her, “<i>She complained first of
her back; her head was thrown back; her body stretched out;
that she twitched, her eyes were drawn aside, staring, and
that when the witness put her hands on the patient’s limbs
they did not relax.</i>” In this case the illness commenced on
the 25th of February; attacks came on the 27th, 28th, and
29th (the last a very slight one), and then again, about a
quarter past eight, on the 1st of March, and the person died
about twenty minutes to eleven on that night. “She principally
complained of prickings in the legs, twitchings in the
muscles and in the hands, which she said she could compare
to nothing else than a galvanic shock. Between the attacks,
she was composed. <i>She wished her husband to rub her legs
and arms.</i> She was dead when the doctor came.”</p>

<p>On <i>cross-examination</i>, the witness said that the sufferer
“<i>could not bear to have her legs touched when the spasms
were strong upon her. Her limbs were rigidly extended when
she asked to be rubbed between the intervals of the spasms.
Touching her then brought on the spasms. Her body was stiff
immediately after death</i>,” but how long it continued so the
witness could not say, as she did not stay long. <i>She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
sensible from half an hour to an hour</i>, from a quarter past
eight till after nine, and the witness <i>supposed she was insensible
the remainder of the time; she did not speak</i>. On
the Saturday before she died the symptoms were the same as
on the other days&mdash;not more violent.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Morley</i>, the surgeon who had attended this case, and
whose opinion as to the symptoms being identical with those
in the present inquiry, was directly opposed by <i>Mr. Nunneley</i>,
of Leeds, who had then assisted him in the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, not only detailed the symptoms he then saw,
but also the method and results of his subsequent examination
of the body.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I had attended,” said Mr. Morley, “on the lady to whom the
last witness has alluded for about two months before her death.
On the Monday before she died she was in her bed, apparently
comfortable, when I observed (as I stood by her side) <i>several slight
convulsive twitchings of her arms</i>. I supposed they arose from
hysteria, and ordered medicine in consequence. <i>The same symptoms
appeared on the following Wednesday and Thursday.</i> I saw her on
Saturday, the day she died. She was apparently better and quite
composed in the middle of the day. She complained of an attack
she had had at night. She spoke of pain and spasms in her back
and neck, and of shocks. I and another medical man were sent
for hastily on Saturday night. We were met by an announcement
that the lady was dead. On the Monday I accompanied another
medical gentleman (Nunneley) to the <i>post-mortem</i> examination.
We found no disease in any part of the body which would account
for death. There was no emaciation, wound, or sore. <i>There was
a peculiar expression of anxiety in the countenance. The hands
were bent and the fingers curved. The feet were strongly arched.</i>
We carefully examined the stomach and its contents for poison.
We applied several tests&mdash;nitric acid, followed by protochloride of
tin,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> sulphuric acid, followed by bichromate of potash in a liquid
and also in a solid state. They are the best tests to detect strychnia.
In each case we found appearances characteristic of strychnia. We
administered the strychnia taken from the stomach to animals by
inoculation&mdash;to two mice, two rabbits, and a guinea-pig, having first
separated it by chemical analysis. We observed in each of the
animals more or less of the effects produced by strychnia, namely&mdash;<i>general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
uneasiness, difficult breathing, convulsions of a tetanic kind,
muscular rigidity, arching backwards of the head and neck, violent
stretching out of the legs.</i> These symptoms appeared in some of the
animals in four or five minutes, in others in less than an hour. The
guinea-pig suffered but slightly at first, and was left, and was dead
next day. The symptoms were strongly marked in the rabbits.
After death there was an interval of flaccidity, after which rigidity
commenced, more than if it had been occasioned by the <i>rigor mortis</i>.
I afterwards made numerous experiments on animals with exactly
similar results, the poison being administered in a fluid form.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Grove.</i>&mdash;“I did not see the patient during
a severe attack. I have observed in animals that spasms are
brought on by touch. That is a very marked symptom. The
spasm is like a galvanic shock. The patient was not at all
insensible during the time I saw her, and she was able to swallow,
but I did not see her during a severe attack. After death we
found the lungs very much congested. There was a small quantity
of bloody serum found in the pericardium. The muscles of the
whole body were dark and soft. There was a decided quantity of
effusion in the brain. There was also a quantity of serum tinged
with blood in the membranes of the spinal cord. The membranes of
the spinal marrow were congested to a considerable extent. We
opened the head first, and there was a good deal of blood flowing out.
<i>Part of the blood may have flowed from the heart. That might
partially empty the heart, and would make it uncertain whether the
heart was full or empty at the time of death. I have often examined
the hearts of animals poisoned by strychnia. The right side of the
heart is generally full.</i> In some cases I think that the symptoms
did not appear for an hour after the administration of the poison.
I have made the experiments in conjunction with Mr. Nunneley.
We have made experiments upon frogs, but they are different in
many respects from warm-blooded animals. I have in almost all
cases found the strychnia where it was known to have been
administered. In one case it was doubtful. We were sure the
strychnia had been administered in that case, but we doubted
whether it had reached the stomach. There were appearances
which might lead one to infer the presence of strychnia, but they
were not satisfactory. I have detected strychnia in the stomach
nearly two months after death, when decomposition has proceeded
to a considerable extent.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“From half a grain to a
grain has been administered to cats, rabbits, and dogs. From one
to two grains is quite sufficient to kill a dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“How does the strychnia act? Is it taken up by the
absorbents, and carried into the system?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I think it acts upon the nerves, but a part may be
taken into the blood and act through the blood. We generally
examined the stomach of the animals when the poison had been
administered internally. Sometimes we examined the skin. The
poison found in the stomach would be in excess of that absorbed
into the system.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are you then of opinion that, a portion of the
poison being taken into the system and a portion being left in the
stomach, the portion taken into the system would produce tetanic
symptoms and death?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee</i> objected to a question which suggested a
theory.</p>

<p><i>The Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“What would be the operation of that
portion of the poison which is taken into the system?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It would destroy life.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Baron Alderson.</i>&mdash;“And yet leave an excess in the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“That is my opinion.”</p>

<p><i>The Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Would the excess remaining in the
stomach produce no effect?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I am not sure that strychnia could lie in the
stomach without acting prejudicially.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Suppose that a minimum quantity is administered,
which, being absorbed into the system, destroys life, should you
expect to find any in the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I should expect sometimes to fail in discovering it.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“If death resulted from a series of minimum doses
spread over several days, would the appearance of the body be
different from that of one whose death had been caused by one
dose?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I should connect the appearance of the body with
the final struggle of the last day.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would you expect a different set of phenomena in
cases where death had taken place after a brief struggle, and in
cases where the struggle had been protracted?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Certainly. At the <i>post-mortem</i> examination of which
I have spoken we found fluid blood in the veins.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“Is it your theory that in the action of
poisoning the poison becomes absorbed and ceases to exist as
poison?”</p>

<p>Answer.&mdash;“I have thought much upon that question, and have
not formed a decided opinion, but I am inclined to think that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
so. A part may be absorbed and a part remain in the stomach
unchanged.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“What chymical reason can you give for
your opinion that strychnia, after having effected the operation
of poisoning, ceases to be strychnia in the blood?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“My opinion rests upon the general principle that, in
acting upon living bodies, organic substances&mdash;such as food and
medicine&mdash;are generally changed in their composition.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“What are the component parts of
strychnia?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Baron Alderson.</i>&mdash;“You will find that in any cyclopædia,
brother Shee.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“Have you any reason to believe that
strychnia can be decomposed by any sort of putrefying or fermenting
process?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I doubt whether it can.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p class="psh">ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, the late <i>Doctor Alfred Swaine Taylor</i>,
the well-known Analytical Chemist and Author of “Medical
Jurisprudence” (the text-book of the legal profession in all
criminal investigations), <i>Doctor Owen Rees</i>, now one of
the physicians extraordinary to her Majesty, and the late
<i>Professor Brande</i>, of the Royal Institution, were called as
witnesses. By the two first, the analytical examination of
the various parts of Mr. Cook’s body had been conducted, and
they had made a joint report of the results. By the last,
that report had been carefully examined, and he had also
heard all the evidence as to symptoms previously given in the
case. No inconsiderable portion of the <i>cross-examination</i> of
Dr. Taylor was occupied by questions connected with the
publication, in the <i>Illustrated Times</i>, by Mr. Augustus
Mayhew, of what professed to be statements as to the details
of their analysis by Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees, in which, if
correctly reported, the former had committed himself somewhat
prematurely to opinions on the case, and had used
expressions towards the prisoner which, to say the least, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not discreet. Dr. Taylor, however, stoutly maintained that
he had not used many of the expressions objected to; that
the opportunity of interviewing him, after the American
fashion, had been unfairly obtained, and the pretended report
published not only without, but contrary to, his expressed
wish. Except, however, as throwing a shade of partisanship
over his conduct, and so far lessening the value of his
evidence, the whole episode was useless to the defence&mdash;perhaps,
to a certain extent, injurious. Dr. Taylor had been
hasty and injudicious, and undoubtedly taken at an advantage
by the energetic reporter, who certainly obtained his interview
with him by pretences not strictly true.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> With these remarks,
due to Dr. Taylor’s reputation and abilities, we proceed to give
his evidence.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor, examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“I
am a fellow of the College of Physicians, lecturer on medical
jurisprudence at Guy’s Hospital, and the author of the well-known
treatise on poisons and on medical jurisprudence. I have made the
poison called strychnia the subject of my attention. It is the produce
of the nux vomica, which also contains brucia, a poison of
an analogous character. Brucia is variously estimated at from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one-sixth to one-twelfth the strength of strychnia. Most varieties
of impure strychnia that are sold contain more or less brucia.
Unless, therefore, you are certain as to the purity of the article,
you may be misled as to its strength. I have performed a variety
of experiments with strychnia on animal life. I have never witnessed
its action on a human subject. I have tried its effects upon
animal life&mdash;upon rabbits&mdash;in ten or twelve instances. The symptoms
are, on the whole, very uniform. The quantity I have given
has varied from half a grain to two grains. Half a grain is sufficient
to destroy a rabbit. I have given it both in a solid and
liquid state. When given in a fluid state it produces its effects in
a very few minutes; when in a solid state, as a sort of pill or
bolus, in about six to eleven minutes. The time varies according
to the strength of the dose, and also to the strength of the
animal.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“In what way does it operate, in your opinion?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is first absorbed into the blood, then circulated
through the body, and especially acts on the spinal cord, from
which proceed the nerves acting on the voluntary muscles.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing the poison has been absorbed, what time
would you give for the circulating process?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The circulation of the blood through the whole
system is considered to take place about once in four minutes.
The circulation in animals is quicker. The absorption of the
poison by rabbits is therefore quicker. The time would also
depend on the state of the stomach,&mdash;whether it contained much
food or not, whether the poison came into immediate contact with
the inner surface of the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“In your opinion, does the poison act immediately
on the nervous system, or must it first be absorbed?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It must first be absorbed.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“The symptoms, you say, are uniform. Will you
describe them?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The animal for about five or six minutes does not
appear to suffer, but moves about gently; when the poison begins
to act it suddenly falls on its side; there is a trembling, a quivering
motion of the whole of the muscles of the body, arising from
the poison producing violent and involuntary contraction. There
is then a sudden paroxysm or fit, the fore legs and the hind legs
are stretched out, the head and the tail are drawn back in the
form of a bow, the jaws are spasmodically closed, the eyes are
prominent; after a short time there is a slight remission of the
symptoms, and the animal appears to lie quiet, but the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
noise or touch reproduces another convulsive paroxysm; sometimes
there is a scream, or a sort of shriek, as if the animal suffered from
pain; the heart beats violently during the fit, and after a succession
of these fits the animal dies quietly. Sometimes, however,
the animal dies during a spasm, and I only know that death has
occurred from holding my hand over the heart. The appearances
after death differ. In some instances the rigidity continues. In
one case the muscles were so strongly contracted for a week afterwards,
that it was possible to hold the body by its hind legs
stretched out horizontally. In an animal killed the other day the
body was flaccid at the time of death, but became rigid about five
minutes afterwards. I have opened the bodies of animals thus
destroyed.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Could you detect any injury in the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. I have found in some cases congestion of the
membranes of the spinal cord to a greater extent than would be
accounted for by the gravitation of the blood. In other cases I
have found no departure from the ordinary state of the spinal cord
and the brain. I ascribe congestion to the succession of fits before
death. In a majority of instances, three out of five, I found no
change in the abnormal condition of the spine. In all cases the
heart has been congested, especially the right side. I saw a case
of ordinary tetanus in the human subject years ago, but I have
not had much experience of such cases. I saw one case last
Thursday week at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. The patient recovered.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You have heard the description given by the witnesses
of the symptoms and appearances which accompanied Cook’s
attacks?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Were those symptoms and appearances the same as
those you have observed in the animals to which you administered
strychnia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They were. Death has taken place in the animals
more rapidly when the poison has been administered in a fluid
than in a solid form. They have died at various periods after the
administration of the poison. The experiments I have performed
lately have been entirely in reference to solid strychnia. In the
first case the symptoms began in seven minutes, and the animal
died (including those seven) in thirteen minutes. In the second
case the symptoms appeared in nine minutes, and the animal died
in seventeen. In the third case the symptoms appeared in ten
minutes, and the animal died in eighteen. In the fourth case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
symptoms appeared in five minutes, and death took place in
twenty-two. In the fifth case the symptoms appeared in twelve
minutes, and death occurred in twenty-three. If the poison were
taken by the human subject in pills it would take a longer time
to act, because the structure of the pill must be broken up in order
to bring the poison in contact with the mucous membrane of the
stomach. I have administered it to rabbits in pills.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would poison given in pills take a longer period to
operate on a human subject than on a rabbit?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not think we can draw any inference from a
comparison of the rapidity of death in a human subject and in a
rabbit. The circulation and absorption are different in the two
cases. There is also a difference between one human subject and
another. The strength of the dose, too, would make a difference,
as a large dose would produce a more rapid effect than a small one.
I have experimented upon the intestines of animals, in order to
reproduce the strychnia. The process consists in putting the
stomach and its contents in alcohol, with a small quantity of acid
which dissolves the strychnia, and produces sulphate of strychnia
in the stomach. The liquid is then filtered, gently evaporated,
and an alkali added&mdash;carbonate of potash, which combines with
the sulphuric acid, and precipitates the strychnia. Tests are
applied to the strychnia, or supposed strychnia, when extracted.
Strychnia has a peculiar strongly bitter taste. It is not soluble
in water, but it is in acids and in alcohol. The colour tests are
applied to the dry residue after evaporation. Change of colour is
produced by a mixture of sulphuric acid and bichromate of potash.
It produces a blue colour, changing to violet and purple, and passing
to red; but colouring tests are very fallacious, with this exception,&mdash;when
we have strychnia separated in its crystallised state we can
recognise the crystals by their form and their chemical properties,
and, above all, by the tetanic symptoms and death when administered
through a wound in the skin of animals.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are there other vegetable substances from which, if
these colouring tests were applied, similar colours could be obtained?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There are a variety of mixtures which produce
similar colours;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> one of them also has a bitter taste like strychnine.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Vegetable poisons are more difficult of detection than
mineral: the tests are far more fallacious. I have endeavoured to
discover the presence of strychnine in animals I have poisoned in
four cases, assisted by Dr. Rees. I have applied the process I
first described. I have applied the tests of colouring and taste.
In one case I discovered some by the colour test. In a second
case there was a bitter taste, but no other indication of strychnine.
In the other two cases there were no indications at all. In the
case where it had been discovered by the colour test, two grains
had been administered; and in the second case, where there was a
bitter taste, one grain. In one of the cases where we failed to
detect it, one grain, and, in the other, half a grain had been given.
I account for the absence of any indication, <i>because it is absorbed
in the blood, and is no longer in the stomach. It is in a great part
changed in the blood.</i> When administered in large doses there is a
retention of some in excess of what is required for the destruction
of life.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing a minimum dose, which will destroy life,
has been given, could you find any?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. It is taken up by absorption, and is no longer
discoverable in the stomach. The smallest quantity by which I
have destroyed an animal is half a grain. <i>There is no process with
which I am acquainted by which it can be discovered in the tissue.</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
As far as I know, a small quantity cannot be discovered.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Suppose half a grain to be absorbed into the blood,
what proportion does it bear to the total quantity of blood circulated
in the system?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Assuming the system to contain the lowest quantity
of blood&mdash;25lb.&mdash;it would be one-fiftieth of a grain to a pound of
blood. A physician once died from a dose of half a grain in twenty
minutes. <i>I believe it undergoes some partial change in the blood
which increases the difficulty of discovering it. I never heard of its
being separated from the tissues in a crystallised state.</i> The crystals
are peculiar in form, but there are other organic crystallised
substances like them, so that a chemist will not rely on form only.
After the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, a portion of the stomach was
delivered to me by Mr. Boycott, covered with bladder, tied and
sealed. The jar contained the stomach and the intestines. I have
experimented upon them with a view to discover if any poison was
present. I sought for prussic acid, morphia, strychnia, veratria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tobacco poison, hemlock, arsenic, antimony, mercury, and other
mineral poisons, but only found small traces of antimony. <i>The
parts on which I had to operate were in the most unfavourable condition
that could possibly be. The stomach had been cut completely from end
to end; all the contents were gone, and the fine mucous surface, on
which any poison, if present, would have been found, was lying in
contact with the outside of the intestines&mdash;all thrown together. The
inside of the stomach was lying in a mass of intestinal fœcal matter.</i>
That was, I presume, the fault or misfortune of the person who
dissected, but it seemed to have been shaken about in every
possible way in its journey to London.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> By my request the
spleen, two kidneys, and a small bottle of blood, were sent up to
me. We had no idea where the blood came from. <i>Each part of
the liver, one kidney, and the spleen, all yielded antimony.</i> It was
reproduced, or brought out by boiling the animal matter in a
mixture of hydrochloric acid and water. Copper, in the shape of
foil and gauze in a sort of web of fine copper, was introduced, and
the antimony was found deposited on the copper. <i>The quantity of
antimony was less in proportion in the spleen than in the other parts.
I detected some antimony in the blood.</i> We applied the tests of
Professor Brande, Dr. Rees, and others. <i>It is impossible to say
how recently it had been administered, but I should say shortly before
death, that is, within some days.</i> The longest period at which antimony
can be found in the blood after death, within my knowledge,
is eight days; the earliest period, within my knowledge, eighteen
hours. A boy died within eighteen hours after taking it, and it
was found in his liver. It is usually given in the form of tartar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
emetic; it acts as an irritant, and produces vomiting. If given in
repeated doses, a portion would find its way into the blood and the
system, beyond what was ejected. If it continued to be given
after it had produced certain symptoms, it would destroy life. It
may, however, be given with impunity.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Referring to the symptoms previously proved in Cook’s
case, the witness said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Vomitings produced by antimony would cause those symptoms.
If given in small quantities, sufficient to cause vomiting, it would
not affect the colour of the liquid with which it was mixed, whether
brandy, wine, broth, or water. <i>It is impossible to form an exact
judgment when the antimony was administered, but it must have been
two or three weeks at the outside before death. There was no
evidence that it was administered within some hours before death.</i>
It might leave a sensation in the throat&mdash;a choking sensation&mdash;if
a large quantity was given at once. <i>I found no trace of mercury
during the analysis. If a few grains had been taken recently before
death, I should have expected to find some trace. If a man had taken
mercury for a syphilitic affection within two or three weeks, I should
have expected to find it.</i> It is very slow in passing out of the body.
As small a quantity as three or four grains might leave some trace.
I recollect a case in which three grains of calomel were given three
or four hours before death, and traces of mercury were found.
Half a grain three or four days before death, if given in divided
doses more favourable for absorption, would, I should expect, leave
a trace. One grain would certainly do so.” The witness agreed with
the opinion of the other witnesses as to the causes of the deaths of
Mrs. Smyth, Agnes French, and the other lady (Mrs. Dove), and
of the attack of Clutterbuck, and that the symptoms in Mr. Cook’s
case appeared to be of a similar character. As a professor of
medical science, he did not know any cause in the range of human
disease, except strychnia, to which the symptoms in Cook’s case
could be referred.</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of <i>Dr. Taylor</i> was necessarily very
diffuse and lengthy; with the exception, however, of the part
in which it was sought to raise a prejudice against the witness
as a partisan, to which I have previously referred, it was so
important that, like the <i>examination</i> in chief, it must, in
justice to all parties, be reported at length.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“I mean by the word
‘trace’ a very small quantity, which can hardly be estimated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
weight. I do not apply it in the sense of an imponderable quantity.
In chemical language it is frequently used in that sense.
An infinitesimal quantity would be called ‘a trace.’ <i>The quantity
of antimony that we discovered in all parts of the body would make
up about half a grain. We did not ascertain that there was that
quantity, but I will undertake to say that we extracted as much as
half a grain. That quantity would not be sufficient to cause death.</i>
Only arsenic or antimony could have been deposited, under the
circumstances, on the copper, and no sublimate of arsenic was
obtained.” [The witness, in reply to a further question, detailed
the elaborate test which he had applied to the deposit, in order to
ascertain that it consisted of antimony.]</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would a mistake in any one of the processes you
have described, or a defect in any of the materials you have used,
defeat the object of the test?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It would, but all the materials I used were pure.
Such an accident could not have happened without my having
some intimation of it in the course of the process. I should think
antimony would operate more quickly upon animals than upon
men. I am acquainted with the works of Orfila. He stood in the
highest rank of analytical chemists.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did not Orfila find antimony in a dog four months
after injection?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; but the animal had taken about forty-five
grains.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee</i> called the attention of the witness to a passage
in Orfila’s work in reference to that case, to the effect that the
antimony was found accumulating in the bones, the liver contained
a great deal, and the tissues a very little.</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes; when antimony has been long in the body it
passes into the bones; but I think you will find that these are not
Orfila’s experiments. Orfila is quoting the experiments of another
person.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“But is not that the case with nearly all the experiments
referred to in your own book?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; I cannot say that.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee</i> again referred to a case in Orfila in which
forty-five grains were given to a dog, and three and a half months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
after death a quantity was found in the fat, and some in the liver,
bones, and tissues.</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“That shows that antimony gets into the bones and
flesh, but I never knew a case in which forty-five grains had been
given to a human being in ten days, and I have given no opinion
upon such a case.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“A pretty good dose is required to poison a person,
I suppose?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“That depends on the mode in which it is given. A
dog has been poisoned with six grains. The dog died in the case
you mentioned. When antimony is administered as it was in that
case the liver becomes fatty and gristled. Cook’s liver presented
no appearance of the sort. <i>I should infer that the antimony we
found in Cook’s body was given much more recently than in the experiments
you have described. We cannot say positively how long it takes
to get out of the body, but I have known three grains cleared out in
twenty-four hours.</i> I was first applied to in this case on Thursday,
the 27th of November, by Mr. Stevens, who was introduced to me
by Mr. Warrington, professor of chemistry. Either then or subsequently
he mentioned Mr. Gardner. I had not known Mr. Gardner
before. I had never before been concerned in cases of this kind at
Rugeley.”</p></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Dr. Rees and I have completed the analysis to-day. We
have sketched a report, which will be ready to-morrow or next day.</p>

<p>“As I am going to Durham Assizes on the part of the Crown, in the case
of <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Wooler</i>, the report will be in the hands of Dr. Rees, No. 26,
Albemarle-street. It will be most desirable that Mr. Stevens should call on
Dr. Rees, read the report with him, and put such questions as may occur.</p>

<p>“In reply to your letter received here this morning I beg to say that we
wish a statement of all the medicines prescribed for deceased (until his death)
to be drawn up and sent to Dr. Rees.</p>

<p>“We do not find strychnine, prussic acid, or any trace of opium. From
the contents having been drained away it is now impossible to say whether
any strychnine had or had not been given just before death, but it is quite
possible for tartar emetic to destroy life if given in repeated doses; and, so
far as we can at present form an opinion, in the absence of any natural cause
of death, the deceased may have died from the effects of antimony in this or
some other form.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Was that your opinion at the time?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It was. We could infer nothing else.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you not said that the quantity of antimony
you found was not sufficient to account for death?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Certainly. If a man takes antimony he first vomits,
and then a part of the antimony goes out of the body; some may
escape from the bowels. A great deal passes at once into the
blood by absorption, and is carried out by the urine.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you say upon your oath that from the traces
in Cook’s body you were justified in stating your opinion that
death was caused by antimony?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; perfectly and distinctly. <i>That which is found
in a dead body is not the slightest criterion as to what the man took
when alive.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“When you gave your opinion that Cook died from
the effects of antimony, had you any reason to think that an undue
quantity had been administered?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I could not tell. People may die from large or small
quantities; the quantity found in the body was no criterion as to
how much he had taken.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“May not the injudicious use of a quack medicine
containing antimony, the injudicious use of James’s powders,
account for the antimony you found in the body?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; the injudicious use of any antimonial medicine
would account for it.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Or even their judicious use?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It might.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“With that knowledge, upon being consulted with
regard to Cook, you gave it as your opinion that he died from the
poison of antimony?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“You pervert my meaning entirely. I said that
antimony in the form of tartar emetic might occasion vomiting
and other symptoms of irritation, and that in large doses it would
cause death, preceded by convulsions.” [The witness was proceeding
to read his report upon the case, but was stopped by the
Court.] “I was told that the deceased was in good health seven
or eight days before his death, and that he had been taken very
sick and ill, and had died in convulsions. No further particulars
being given us, we were left to suppose that he had not died a
natural death. There was no natural cause to account for death;
and finding antimony existing throughout the body, we thought it
might have been caused by antimony. An analysis cannot be
made effectually without information.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You think it necessary before you can rely upon an
analysis to have received a long statement of the symptoms before
death?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“A short statement will do.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You allow your judgment to be influenced by the
statement of a person who knows nothing of his own knowledge?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not allow my judgment to be influenced in any
way; I judge by the result.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean to say that what Mr. Stevens told
you did not assist you in arriving at the conclusion you state in
writing?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I stated it as a possible case&mdash;not as a certainty.
If we had found a large quantity of tartar emetic in the stomach
we should have come to the conclusion that the man died from it.
As we found only a small quantity, we said he might have died
from it. I attended the coroner’s inquest, first, I think, on December
14. Some of the evidence was read over to me. I think that
Dr. Harland was the first witness I heard examined. I heard
Mr. Bamford, and also Lavinia Barnes. I cannot say as to
Newton. I heard Jones. I had experimented some years ago on
five of the rabbits I have mentioned. That is the only knowledge
of my own that I had of the effect of strychnia upon animal life
when I wrote my book. I have a great objection to the sacrifice of
life. No toxicologist will sacrifice the lives of one hundred rabbits
to establish facts which he knows to be already well established.
I experimented on the last rabbits since the inquest.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you not think it rather rash to judge of the
effects of strychnia on man by so small an experiment?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“You must add to the experiment the study of
poisons and cases.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you not think that a rabbit is a very unfair
animal to select?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would not a dog be better?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They are very dangerous to handle.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean to give that answer?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Dogs and cats bear a greater analogy to man because
they vomit, while rabbits do not; but rabbits are much more
manageable.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you admit that as to the action of the respiratory
organs they would be better than rabbits?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“As to the effect of poison would they not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I think a rabbit quite as good as any animal. The
poison is retained, and its operation is shown. At the inquest I
saw Mr. Gardner (the solicitor of Mr. Stevens). I suggested
questions to the coroner. Some of them he put to the witnesses,
and others they answered upon my suggesting them. Ten days
before the inquest Mr. Gardner informed me in his letter that
strychnia, Battley’s solution, and prussic acid, had been purchased
on Tuesday; that was why I used the expressions to which you
have referred. We did not allow that information to have any
influence on our report.” [The witness’s deposition before the
coroner was then read.] “Having given my evidence, I returned
to town, and soon afterwards heard that the prisoner had been
committed on a charge of wilful murder.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“And that his life depended in a great degree
on you?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. I simply gave an opinion as to the poison, not
as to the prisoner’s case. I knew I should probably be examined
as a witness on the trial.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you think it your duty to abstain from all
public discussion of the question which might influence the public
mind.”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did you write a letter to the <i>Lancet</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, to contradict several mis-statements of my
evidence that had been made.”</p>

<p><i>Letter to</i> Lancet <i>of Feb. 2, 1856, read, in which Dr. Taylor said</i>:&mdash;“During
the quarter of a century which I have now specially
devoted to toxicological inquiries, I have never met with any cases
like these suspected cases of poisoning at Rugeley. The mode in
which they will affect the person accused is of minor importance compared
with their probable influence on society. I have no hesitation
in saying that the future security of life in this country will mainly
depend on the judge, the jury, and the counsel who may have to
dispose of the charges of murder which have arisen out of these

<p><i>Cross-examination continued.</i>&mdash;“That is my opinion now. It
had been stated that if strychnia caused death it could always be
found, which I deny. It had also been circulated in every newspaper
that a person could not be killed by tartar emetic, which I
deny, and which might have led to the destruction of hundreds of
lives. I entertained no prejudice against the prisoner. What I
meant was that if these statements which I had seen in medical
and other periodicals were to have their way there was not a life in
the country which was safe.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you adhere to your opinion that ‘the mode in
which they will affect the person accused,’ that is, lead him to the
scaffold, ‘is of minor importance, compared with their probable
influence on society’?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have never suggested that they should lead him to
the scaffold. I hope that, if innocent, he will be acquitted.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What do you mean by the mode in which they will
affect the person accused being of minor importance?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The lives of sixteen millions of people are, in my
opinion, of greater importance than that of one man.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“That is your opinion?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes. As you appear to put that as an objection to
my evidence, allow me to state that in two dead bodies I find
antimony. In one case death occurred suddenly, and in the other
the body was saturated with antimony, which I never found before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in the examination of three hundred bodies. I say these were
circumstances which demanded explanation.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You adhere to the opinion that, as a medical man
and a member of an honourable profession, you were right in
publishing this letter before the trial of the person accused?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I think I had a right to state that opinion in
answer to the comments which had been made upon my evidence.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Had any comments been made by the prisoner?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Or by any of his family?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Mr. Smith, the solicitor for the defence, circulated in
every paper statements of ‘Dr. Taylor’s inaccuracy.’ I had no wish
or motive to charge the prisoner with this crime. My duty
concerns the lives of all.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">I omit here the numerous questions about Mr. Mayhew’s
visit, and take up the <i>cross-examination</i> with the witness’s
opinion of Cook’s symptoms.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Cook’s symptoms were quite in accordance with an ordinary
case of poisoning by strychnia.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you tell me any case in which a patient after
being seized with tetanic symptoms sat up in bed and talked?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It was after he sat up that Cook was seized with
these symptoms.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you refer to a case in which a patient who had
taken strychnia beat the bed with his or her arms?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is exactly what I should expect to arise from a
sense of suffocation.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you know in your reading of any case in which
the symptoms of poisoning by strychnia commenced with beating
of the bed clothes?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There have been only about fifteen cases, and in none
of those was the patient seized in bed. Beating of the bed clothes
is a symptom which may be exhibited by a person suffering from
a sense of suffocation, whether caused by strychnia or other causes.
A case has been communicated to me by a friend, in which the
patient shook as though with an ague.” [Answer objected to, but
allowed as witness had been questioned as to the results of his
reading.] “I have known of no case of poisoning by strychnia in
which the patient screamed before he was seized. That is common
in ordinary convulsions. In cases of poisoning by strychnia the
patient screams when the spasms set in; the pain is very severe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
I cannot refer to a case in which the patient has spoken freely after
the paroxysms had commenced.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you refer me to any case in an authentic publication
in which the access of the strychnia paroxysm has been
delayed so long after the injection of the poison as in the case of
Cook on Tuesday night?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; longer. In my book on Medical Jurisprudence,
p. 185, 5th Edition, it is stated that in a case communicated to the
<i>Lancet</i>, Aug. 31, 1850, by Mr. Bennett, a grain and a half of
strychnia taken by mistake destroyed the life of a healthy female
in an hour and a half. None of the symptoms appeared for an
hour. There is a case in which the period which elapsed was two
hours and a half. A grain and a half is a full, but not a very considerable,
dose. In my book on Poisons there is no case in which
the paroxysm commenced more than an hour and a half after the
injection of the poison. That book is eight years old, and since
1848 cases have occurred. There is a mention of one in which
three hours elapsed before the paroxysms occurred.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee</i> then referred to the case, and called
attention to the fact that the only statement as to time was
that in three hours the patient lost his speech, and was seized
with violent convulsions.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Cross-examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I know of no other fatal case in
which the interval was so long. In that case there was disease of
the brain. Referring to the <i>Lancet</i>, I find that in the case to which
I referred, as communicated by Dr. Bennett, the strychnia was dissolved
in cinnamon water. Being dissolved, one would have
expected it to have a more speedy action. The time in which a
patient would recover would depend entirely upon the dose of
strychnia which had been taken. I do not remember any case in
which a patient recovered in three or four hours, but such cases
must have occurred. There is one mentioned in my book on
Medical Jurisprudence. The patient had taken nux vomica, but
its powers depend upon strychnia. In that case the violence of the
paroxysms gradually subsided, and the next day, although feeble
and exhausted, the patient was able to walk home. The time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the recovery is a point which is not usually stated by medical men.
I cannot mention any case in which there was a repetition of the
paroxysms after so long an interval as that from Monday to Tuesday
night, which occurred in Cook’s case. I do not think that the
attack on Tuesday night was the result of anything which had
been administered to him on the Monday night. In the cases of
four out of five rabbits the rigidity was continued at the time of
death and after death. In the other the animal was flaccid at the
time of death.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are you acquainted with this opinion of Dr. Christison,
that in these cases rigidity does not come on at the time of
death, but comes on shortly afterwards?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Dr. Christison speaks from his experience, and I from
mine.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did you hear that Dr. Bamford said that when he
arrived he found the body of Cook quite straight in bed?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can that have been a case of ophisthotonos?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It may have been.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are not the colour tests of strychnia so uncertain
and fallacious that they cannot be depended upon?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, unless you first get the strychnia in a visible
and tangible form.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is it not impossible to get it so from the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is not impossible; it depends upon the quantity
which remains there.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You do not agree that the fiftieth part of a grain
might be discovered?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I think not.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Nor even half a grain?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“That might be. It would depend upon the quantity
of food in the stomach with which it was mixed.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“In cases of death from
strychnia the heart is sometimes found empty after death. That
is the case of human subjects. There are three such cases on
record. I think that emptiness results from spasmodic affection of
the heart. I know of no reason why that should rather occur in
the case of man than in that of a small animal like a rabbit.
The heart is generally more filled when the paroxysms are frequent.
When the paroxysm is short and violent, and causes death in a few
moments, I should expect to find the heart empty. The rigidity
after death always affects the same muscles; those of the limbs
and back. In the case of the rabbit, in which the rigidity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
relaxed at the time of death, it returned while the body was warm.
In ordinary death it only occurs when the body is cold, or nearly
so. I never knew a case of tetanus in which the rigidity lasted
two months after death; but such a fact would give me the
impression that there were very violent spasms. It would indicate
great violence of the spasms from which the person died. The
time which elapses between the taking of strychnia and the commencement
of the paroxysms depends on the constitution and
strength of the individual. A feeling of suffocation is one of the
earliest symptoms of poisoning by strychnia, and that would lead
the patient to beat the bedclothes. I have no doubt that the
substances I used for the purpose of analysis were pure. I had
tested them. The fact that three distinct processes each gave the
same result was strong confirmation of each. I have no doubt
that what we found was antimony. The quantity found does not
enable me to say how much was taken. It might be the residue
of either large or small doses. Sickness would throw off some
portion of the antimony which had been administered. We did
not analyse the bones and tissues. I suggested questions to the
coroner because he did not put such as enabled me to form an
opinion. I think that arose rather from want of knowledge than
intention. There was an omission to take down the answers. At
the time I wrote to Mr. Gardiner I had not learnt the symptoms
which attended the attack and death of Cook. I had only the
information that he was well seven days before he died, and had
died in convulsions. I had not information to lead me to suppose
that strychnia had been the cause of death, except that Palmer had
purchased strychnia. Failing to find opium, prussic acid, or
strychnia, I referred to antimony as the only substance found in
the body. Before writing to the <i>Lancet</i>, I had been made the
subject of a great many attacks. What I had said as to the
possibility or impossibility of discovering strychnia after death had
been misrepresented. In various newspapers it had been represented
that I had said strychnia could never be detected&mdash;that it was
destroyed by putrefaction. What I had said was, that when
absorbed in the blood it could not be separated as strychnia. I
wrote the letter in my own vindication.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Rees</i> and <i>Professor Brande</i> briefly but decidedly confirmed
the statements, and coincided with the opinions
expressed by Dr. Taylor, the latter witness speaking as to an
experiment made by him to test the accuracy of the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
one, with reference to the supposed presence of antimony,
which enabled him to state positively that that poison was
isolated by it. <i>Professor Christison</i>, of the University of
Edinburgh, author of the well-known treatise on poisons, was
then called, and gave the following evidence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Professor Christison</i> said:&mdash;“I am a fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians and Professor of Materia Medica to the University of
Edinburgh; I am also the author of a work on the subject of
poisons, and I have directed a good deal of attention to strychnia.
In my opinion it acts by absorption into the blood, and through
that upon the nervous system. I have seen its effects upon a
human subject, but not a fatal case. I have seen it tried upon
pigs, rabbits, cats, and one wild boar. (A laugh.) I first directed
my attention to this poison in 1820, in Paris. It had been
discovered two years before in Paris. In most of my experiments
upon animals I gave very small doses&mdash;a sixth of a grain; but I
once administered a grain. I cannot say how small a dose would
cause the death of an animal by administration into the stomach.
I generally applied it by injection through an incision in the cavity
of the chest. A sixth part of a grain so administered killed a dog
in two minutes. I once administered to a rabbit, through the
stomach, a dose of a grain. I saw Dr. Taylor administer three-quarters
of a grain to a rabbit, and it was all swallowed except
a very small quantity. The symptoms are nearly the same in
rabbits, cats, and dogs. The first is a slight tremor and unwillingness
to move; then frequently the animal jerks its head
back slightly; soon after that all the symptoms of tetanus come on
which have been so often described by the previous witnesses.
When the poison is administered by the stomach death generally
takes place between a period of five minutes and five and twenty
minutes after the symptoms first make their appearance. I have
frequently opened the bodies of animals thus killed, and have never
been able to trace any effect of the poison upon the stomach or
intestines, or upon the spinal cord or brain, that I could attribute
satisfactorily to the poison. The heart of the animal generally
contained blood in all the cases in which I have been concerned.
In the case of the wild boar the poison was injected into the chest.
A third of a grain was all that was used, and in ten minutes the
symptoms began to show themselves. If strychnia was administered
in the form of a pill it might be mixed with other ingredients that
would protract the period of its operation. This would be the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
if it were mixed with resinous materials, or any materials that were
difficult of digestion, and such materials would be within the
knowledge of any medical men, and they are frequently used for the
purpose of making ordinary pills. Absorption in such a case would
not commence until the pill was broken down by the process of
digestion. In the present state of our knowledge of the subject I
do not think it is possible to fix the precise time when the operation
of the poison commences on a human subject. In the case of an
animal we take care that it is fasting, and we mix the poison with
ingredients that are readily soluble, and in every circumstance
favourable for the development of the poison. I have seen many
cases of tetanus arising from wounds and other causes. The general
symptoms of the disorder very nearly resemble each other, and in
all the natural forms of tetanus the symptoms begin and advance
much more slowly, and they prove fatal much more slowly, and
there is no intermission in certain forms of natural tetanus. In
tetanus from strychnia there are short intermissions. I have
heard the evidence of what took place at the ‘Talbot Arms’ on
the Monday and Tuesday, and the result of my experience induces
me to come to the conclusion that the symptoms exhibited by the
deceased were only attributable to strychnia, or the four poisons
containing it: namely, nux vomica, St. Ignatius’s bean, snakewood,
and a draught poison called “exhetwick.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> There is no natural
disease of any description that I am acquainted with to which I
could refer these symptoms. In cases of tetanus consciousness
remains to the very last moment. When death takes place in a
human subject by spasm it tends to empty the heart of blood.
When death is the consequence of the administration of strychnia,
if the quantity is small, I should not expect to find any trace in
the body after death. If there was an excess of quantity more
than was required to cause the death by absorption, I should
expect to find that excess in the stomach. The colour tests for
the detection of the presence of strychnia are uncertain. Vegetable
poisons are more difficult of detection than mineral ones, and there
is one poison with which I am acquainted for which no known test
has been discovered. The stomach of the deceased was sent in a
very unsatisfactory state for examination, and there must have been
a considerable quantity of strychnia in the stomach to have enabled
any one to detect its presence under such circumstances.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Grove.</i>&mdash;“The experiments I refer to
were made many years ago. In one instance I tried one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
colour tests in the case of a man who was poisoned by strychnia,
but I failed to discover the presence of the poison in the stomach.
I tried the test for the development of the violet colour by means
of sulphuric acid and oxide of lead. From my own observation I
should say that animals destroyed by strychnia die of asphyxia,
but in my work, which has been referred to, it will be seen that I
have left the question open.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Some further questions were put to the witness by the
learned counsel for the prisoner in reference to opinions
expressed by him in his work, and he explained that this
work was written twelve years ago, and that the experience
he had since obtained had modified some of the opinions he
then entertained.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Cross-examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I have not noticed that in cases
where a patient is suffering from strychnia the slightest touch
appears to bring on the paroxysm. It is very remarkable in the
case of animals, unless you touch them very gently indeed.
Strychnia has a most intensely bitter taste. It is said on the
authority of a French chemist that a grain will give a taste to
more than a gallon of water. If resinous substances were used in
the formation of a pill it does not follow that they would necessarily
be found in the stomach; they might be passed off.”</p>

<p><i>By the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“One of the cases quoted in the
work that has been referred to was that of a gamekeeper, who was
found dead; his head was thrown back, his hands were clenched,
and his limbs were rigid. A paper containing strychnia was found
in his pocket, and upon a <i>post-mortem</i> examination, there were indications
which, under the circumstances, satisfied me of the existence
of strychnia. There was a substance in the body of an intensely
bitter taste, which was tested by the colour test, and it succeeded
in one instance, but failed in another. It appears that colour tests
are not to be relied upon in the case of strychnia in an impure
condition: in the first place, you may not find indication of
strychnia: and, secondly, they are subject to fallacy even if the
strychnia is pure from other substances not containing strychnia
presenting similar appearances.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">With the <i>examination</i> of this witness, the medical and
scientific evidence for the prosecution was closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">MEDICO-SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>The conflict in the testimony given by scientific experts in
this case, will be more clearly shown if, instead of deferring it
to its original position, after the speech for the defence, the
evidence of the eminent medical men and analysts is at once
contrasted with that of those called for the prosecution. The
two points mainly in contest were, (1.) Were the symptoms in
Cook’s case such as could only be produced by <i>strychnia</i>, or
could they have arisen from other diseases, and especially
from one of the forms of ordinary <i>tetanus</i>? (2.) If strychnia
had been given, could it not have been discovered by chemical
analysis?<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Under the <i>first</i> head came the consideration of
Cook’s mode of life and general state of health, and his excitement
at the victory of his horse at such a critical period of
his fortunes, as predisposing causes to one or other of the
various diseases to which the witnesses for the defence were
prepared to attribute the symptoms and the result. Under
the <i>second</i>, the success that uniformly attended such analysts
as Mr. Herapath in detecting, even twenty times less than the
fiftieth part of a grain of strychnia, and the inference that as
it was not discovered by such eminent analysts as Dr. Taylor
and Dr. Rees, that none had been given. If this inference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was fair, it would follow that, however mysterious the causes
of the death of Cook might have been, and the symptoms of
his attacks difficult of being referred to any known form of
disease, yet it was not proved that he died of strychnia, and
that therefore Palmer was entitled to an acquittal. “According
to the witnesses for the Crown,” said Serjeant Shee, “the
poison of strychnia is of that nature, that when it has done
its fatal work, and become absorbed into the system, it ceases
to be the thing it was when it was taken into the system; it
becomes decomposed, its elements separated from each other,
and, therefore, no longer capable of responding to the tests
which, according to Taylor, would certainly detect the presence
of undecomposed strychnia. They account for the fact that
it is not detected, and for their still believing that it destroyed
Mr. Cook, by this hypothesis. Now it is only an hypothesis:
there is no foundation for it in experiment: it is not supported
by the evidence of any eminent toxicologists but themselves;
it was the theory of Dr. Taylor, which he propounds
in his book&mdash;but he propounds it as a theory of his own; he
does not vouch, as I remember, any eminent toxicologist in
support of it.”</p>

<p>Against this theory, among other eminent men, the defence
called <i>Mr. Nunneley</i>, of Leeds, who had assisted Mr. Morley
(previously called for the prosecution) in the case of Mrs.
Dove, <i>Dr. Letheby</i>, the medical officer of health of the city of
London, and <i>Mr. William Herapath</i>. Of these three experts
it will be advisable to give the evidence at some length, contenting
oneself with summarising that of the other scientific
witnesses who agreed with them in rejecting, as a scientific
heresy, the hypothesis of Dr. Taylor.</p>

<p>The evidence of <i>Mr. Nunneley</i> covered both points&mdash;the
character of Cook’s symptoms and the discovery of strychnia.
“He had been, he said, in large practice for more than
twenty-five years, and had seen four cases of <i>idiopathic
tetanus</i>, all of which did not commence with lockjaw; in one
of them lockjaw not becoming so marked as to prevent the
person from swallowing once during the disease.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I assume,” said the witness, “that Cook was a man of very
delicate constitution; that for a long time he had felt himself
ailing, for which indisposition he had been under medical treatment;
that he had suffered from syphilis; that he had disease of
the lungs, and an old standing disease of the throat; that he led
an irregular life; that he was subject to mental depression and
excitement, and that after death appearances were found in his
body to show this to have been the case. There was an unusual
appearance in the stomach. The throat was in an unnatural condition.
The back of the tongue showed similar indications. The
air vessels of the lungs were dilated. In the lining of the aorta
there was an unnatural deposit, and there was an unusual appearance
in the membranes of the spinal marrow. One of the witnesses
also said there was a loss of substance from the penis.
That scar on it could only have resulted from an ulcer. A chancre
is an ulcer, but an ulcer is not necessarily a chancre. The symptoms
at the root of the tongue and throat I should ascribe to
syphilitic inflammation of the throat. <i>Supposing these symptoms to
be correct</i>” (<i>which they were not</i>), “I should infer that Cook’s health
had not for a long time been good, and that his constitution was
delicate. His father and mother died young. <i>Supposing that to
have been his state of health</i>, it would make him liable to nervous
irritation. That might be excited by moral causes. Any excitement
or depression might produce that effect. A person of <i>such</i>
health and constitution would be more susceptible of the injurious
influence of wet and cold than one of a stronger one. Upon <i>such
a constitution</i> convulsive disease is more likely to supervene. I
understand he had three attacks on succeeding nights, occurring
about the same hour. As a medical man I should infer from this
that they were of a convulsive character&mdash;<i>in the absence of other
causes to account for</i> them. Convulsive attacks are as various as
possible in their forms and degrees of violence: it is not possible
to give a definite name to every convulsive symptom. There are
some forms of convulsion in which the patient retains consciousness.
Those are forms of hysteria, sometimes found in the male
sex. It is also stated that there are forms of epilepsy in which
the patient retains consciousness.”</p>

<p><i>To Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“<i>I cannot mention a case in which consciousness
has been retained during the fit. No such case has come under
my notice.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I know from reading that, though
rarely, it does sometimes occur. The degree of consciousness in
epilepsy varies very much. In some attacks it is wholly lost for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
long time. Convulsive attacks are sometimes accompanied by
violent spasms and rigidity of the limbs&mdash;they sometimes assume
tetanic complexion. I agree with Dr. Copland that convulsions
arise from almost any cause. Affections of the spinal cord, or
eating indigestible food, will produce them. I know of no case in
which they resulted from retching and vomiting. I agree with
Dr. Copland that they sometimes end immediately in death. The
immediate proximate cause of death is frequently asphyxia. Death
from spasm of the heart is often described as death by asphyxia.
I have seen convulsions recurring&mdash;in various cases. The time at
which a patient recovers his ease after a violent attack of convulsions
varies very much. It may be a few minutes, it may be hours.
From an interval between one convulsion and another I should
infer that the convulsions arose from slight irritation in the brain
or the spinal cord. When death takes place in such paroxysms
there is sometimes no trace of organic disease to be found by a
<i>post-mortem</i> examination. <i>Granules between the</i> <span class="smcap">DURA MATER</span> <i>and
the</i> <span class="smcap">ARACHNOID</span> <i>are not common at any age. I should not draw any
particular inference from their appearance. They might or might
not lead to a conjecture as to their cause and effect. I do not form
any opinion upon these points.</i> They might produce an effect upon
the spinal cord. There are three preparations in museums where
granules are exhibited in the spinal cord, in which the patients are
said to have died from tetanus. Those are at St. Thomas’s Hospital.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
To ascertain the nature and effect of such granules the
spinal cord ought to be examined immediately after death. Not
the most remote opinion could be formed upon an examination
made two months after death, more especially if the brain had
been previously opened. Independently of the appearance of
granules, it would not after that period be possible to form a
satisfactory opinion upon the general condition of the spinal cord.
If there were a large tumour, or some similar change, it might be
exhibited; but neither softening nor induration of the structure
could be perceived. The nervous structure changes within two
days of death. To ascertain minutely its condition it is necessary
to use a lens or microscope. That is required in an examination
made immediately after death. I have attended cases of <i>traumatic
tetanus</i>. That disease commonly begins with an attack upon the
jaw. One of the cases of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i> that I have seen was
my own child. In three of those cases the disease began with
lockjaw. The fourth case commenced in the body, the facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of swallowing remaining. I have within the last twelve months
made <i>post-mortem</i> examinations of two persons who had died from
strychnia. I did not see the patients before death. In both cases
I ascertained by chemical analysis that death had been caused by
strychnia. In both I found the strychnia. In one case&mdash;that of
a lady aged twenty-eight years&mdash;I made my examination forty-two
hours after death, and in the other thirty hours. In the former
case the body had not been opened before I commenced my examination.”
[The witness read a report of this examination, in which
it was stated that the eyelids were partially open, the globes
flaccid, and the pupils dilated. The muscles of the trunk were not
in the least rigid; indeed, they were so soft that the body might
be bent in any direction. The muscles at the hip and shoulder
joints were not quite so flaccid, but they allowed these joints to be
easily moved; while those of the head and neck, forearms, &amp;c.,
were rigid. The fingers were curved, and the feet somewhat
arched. All the muscles, when cut into, were found soft and dark
in colour. The membranes of the liver were exceedingly vascular.
The membrane of the spinal cord was much congested. There
was bloody serum in the pericardium; the lungs were distended,
and some of the air cells were ruptured. The lining membrane of
the trachea and bronchial tubes was covered with a layer of dark
bloody mucus of a dark chocolate colour. The thoracic vessels
and membranes were much congested, and the blood was everywhere
dark and fluid.] After reading this report the witness continued:&mdash;“In
the second case I made my examination thirty hours
after death. I first saw the body about twelve hours after death.
It was a woman somewhere near twenty years of age.” [The witness
also read the report of the examination in this case. The
appearances of the body were substantially similar to those presented
in the previous case.] “In two other cases I have seen a
patient suffering from over doses of strychnia. Neither of those
cases was fatal. In one case I had prescribed the twelfth of a
grain, and the patient took one-sixth. That was for a man of
middle age. Strychnia had been given in solution. In a few
minutes the symptoms appeared. They were a want of power to
control the muscles, manifested by twitchings, rigidity, and cramp,
more violent in the legs than in any other part of the body. The
spasms were not very violent. They continued six hours before
they entirely disappeared. During that time they were intermittent
at various intervals. As the attack passed off the length
of the intervals increased. At first their length was but a few
seconds. The spasms were not combated by medical treatment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
The other case was a very similar one. The quantity taken was
the same&mdash;double what I had prescribed. I have experimented
upon upwards of sixty animals with strychnia. Those animals
were dogs, cats, rats, mice, guinea pigs, frogs, and toads. The
symptoms of the attack in all animals present great resemblances.
Some animals are, however, much more susceptible of its influence
than others are. The period elapsing between the injection of the
poison and the commencement of the symptoms has been from two
minutes to thirty,&mdash;more generally five or six. I administered
the poison occasionally in solution, but more generally in its solid
state. It was sometimes placed dry upon the back of the tongue,
and some fluid poured down the throat; sometimes it was enclosed
between two portions of meat; sometimes mixed up with butter or
suet, and sometimes rolled up in a small piece of gut. To frogs and
toads it was administered by putting them into a solution of strychnia.
I have also applied it direct to the spinal cord, and in other cases
to the brain. The first symptom has been a desire to be quite still;
then hurried breathing; then slavering at the mouth (when the poison
had been given through that organ); then twitching of the ears, trembling
of the muscles, inability to walk, convulsions of all the muscles
of the body, the jaws being generally firmly closed; the convulsions
attended by a total want of power in the muscles, which on the
least touch were thrown into violent spasms with a galvanic-like
shock. Spasms also come on if the animal voluntarily attempts to
move; that is usually the case, but occasionally the animal is able
to move without inducing a recurrence of the spasms. These
spasms recur at various periods, but do not always increase in
violence. The animals die after periods varying from three hours
to three hours and a half. In the cases where the animals live
longest, the paroxysms occur at the longest intervals. In all cases
in the interval before death the rigidity ceases (I know no exception
to this) and the muscles become quite soft, powerless, and
flaccid. The limbs may be put in any position whatever. There
is but little difference from ordinary cases of convulsive death in
the time at which the <i>rigor mortis</i> comes on. I have destroyed
animals with other poisons, and there is very little difference
between the rigidity in their cases and that in the cases of death
from strychnia. In the two women I have mentioned the <i>rigor
mortis</i> was much less than is usual in cases of death from natural
disease. I have known fatal cases of poisoning animals by strychnia
in which there has between the first and the second paroxysm been
an interval of about half-an-hour, but that is not common. I have
examined the bodies of upwards of forty animals killed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
strychnia. I have invariably found the heart full on the right
side; very generally the left ventricle firmly contracted, and the
blood usually dark, and often fluid. There is no particular appearance
about the spine. I have experimented with other poisons
upon upwards of 3000 animals, and have written upon this subject.
It very often happens that in the case of animals dying
suddenly from poisoning the blood is fluid after death. That also
happens in cases of sudden death from other causes. I have
attended to the evidence as to the symptoms exhibited by Cook on
the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. The symptoms on
Sunday night I assume to have been from great excitement. Cook
described himself as having been very ill, and in such a state that
he considered himself mad for a few minutes. He stated that the
cause of this was a noise in the street. These symptoms in the
three nights I have mentioned, do not resemble those which I have
seen follow the administration of strychnia. Cook had more power
of voluntary motion than I have observed in animals under the
influence of this poison. He sat up in bed, and moved his hands
about freely, swallowed, talked, and asked to be rubbed and moved,
none of which, if poisoned by strychnia, could he have done. The
sudden accession of the convulsions is another reason for believing
that they were not produced by strychnia. Other reasons for
believing that the convulsions were not produced by strychnia are
their sudden accession without the usual premonitory symptoms,
the length of time which had elapsed between their commencement
and the taking of the pills which are supposed to have contained
poison, and the screaming and vomiting. I never knew an animal
which had been poisoned with strychnia to vomit or scream voluntarily.
I apprehend that where there is so much spasm of the
heart there must be inability to vomit. In the cases related in
which attempts were made to produce vomiting they did not succeed.
There is such a case in the 10th volume of the <i>Journal de
Pharmacie</i>, in which an emetic was given without success. The
symptoms exhibited after death by animals poisoned by strychnia
differ materially from those presented by the body of Cook. In
his case the heart is stated to have been empty and uncontracted.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“I do not remember that. I think it was said
that it was contracted.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Baron Alderson.</i>-”According to my note, Dr. Harland said
that the heart was contracted, and contained no blood.”</p>

<p><i>Examination continued.</i>&mdash;“The lungs were not congested, nor was
the brain. In the case of animals which have recovered the
paroxysms have subsided gradually. I never knew a severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
paroxysm followed by a long interval of repose. I have experimented
upon the discovery of strychnia in the bodies of animals in
various stages of decomposition, from a few hours after death up to
the forty-third day, in which latter case the body was quite putrid.
It has never happened to me to fail to discover the poison. I have
experimented in about fifteen cases.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing a person to have died under the influence
of strychnia poison in the first paroxysm, and his stomach to have
been taken out and put into a jar on the sixth day after death,
must strychnia have, by a proper analysis, been found in the body?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes. If the strychnia be pure, such as is almost
invariably found among medical men and druggists, the test
is nitric acid, which gives a red colour, which in a great measure
disappears on the addition of protochloride of tin.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> If the
strychnia be pure, it does not undergo any change on the
addition of sulphuric acid, but on the addition of a mixture of
bichromate of potash, with several other substances it produces a
beautiful purple, which changes to varying shades until it gets
to be a dirty red. There are several other tests. In this case the
stomach was not, in my opinion, in an unfavourable condition for
examination. The circumstances attending its position in the jar
and its removal to London would give a little more trouble, but
would not otherwise affect the result. If the deceased had died
from strychnia poison it ought to have been found in the liver,
spleen, and kidneys. I have seen this poison found in similar portions
of animals which had been killed by it. I have also seen it
found in the blood; that was by Mr. Herapath, of Bristol.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Could the analyses be defeated or confused by the
existence in the stomach of any other substance which would produce
the same colours?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. Supposing that pyroxanthine and salicine were
in the parts examined, their existence would not defeat the analysis.
Pyroxanthine is very unlikely to be found in the stomach. It is one
of the rarest and most difficult to be obtained. The distinction
between pyroxanthine and strychnia is quite evident. Pyroxanthine
changes to a deep purple on the addition of sulphuric acid alone,
and the bichromate of potash spoils the colour. In strychnia no
change is produced by sulphuric acid. It requires the addition of
the bichromate to produce the colour.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing the death to have been caused by a dose
of strychnia, not more than sufficient to destroy the animal, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it be so diffused by the process of absorption that you would not
be able by these tests to detect it in any portion of the system?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; I believe it would not. That question had
occupied my attention before I was called upon to give evidence in
this trial. My reason for stating that strychnia when it has done
its work continues as strychnia in the system is, that those who
say some change takes place, argue, that as food undergoes a
change, so does poison; it becomes decomposed. But the change
in food takes place in digestion; consequently its traces are not
found in the blood. Substances like strychnia are absorbed without
digestion, and may be obtained unchanged from the blood. They
may be administered in various ways.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“In your judgment, will any amount of putrefaction
prevent the discovery of strychnia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“To say that it is absolutely indestructible would be
absurd, but within ordinary limits, no. I have found it at the end
of forty days. The emptier the stomach, the quicker the action of
strychnia.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> by the <i>Attorney-General</i>, the witness,
who, to judge from the expressions that passed between them,
assumed an antagonistic position to the prosecution, after
admitting that perhaps half of his sixty experiments had been
made in conjunction with Mr. Morley, and spread over thirty
years; that some had been made after the Leeds case, and
some in reference to the present, and that he had been in consultation
with the prisoner’s attorney since the case at Leeds,
to whom he had transmitted its details, he thus continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The general dose in these experiments was from half a grain to
two grains; half a grain is sufficient to destroy life in larger
animals. I have seen both a dog and a cat die of this dose, but
not always. Some animals as a species are more susceptible than
those of a different species, and among animals of the same species
some are more susceptible than others. The symptoms in the
experiments I have mentioned did not occur after so long a period
as an hour. We have had to repeat the dose in some instances
when half a grain was given. In the case of a cat, symptoms of
spasm were produced, but the cat did not die; she had not swallowed
the whole dose. I think I have known animals of the cat
species killed with half a grain.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you any doubt of it?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes. I think it would be the minimum dose in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
old strong cat. If given in a fluid state I think a smaller dose
would suffice. Hurried breathing is one of the first symptoms,
afterwards there are twitchings and trembling of the muscles and
then convulsions.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is there any diversity in the intervals and order of
the symptoms in animals of the same species?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They certainly do not occur after the same intervals of
time, but I should say they generally occur in the order I have
described. There is some difference in the periods at which the
convulsions take place. Some will die after less convulsions than
others, but generally after four or five. In one or two instances an
animal has died after one convulsion. In those instances a dose
has been given equal in amount to another which has not produced
the same effect. The order in which the muscles are convulsed
varies to some extent. The muscles of the limbs are generally
affected first. The convulsions generally occur simultaneously.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you know of any case of strychnia in which
rigidity after death was greater than the usual <i>rigor mortis</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I think not. I don’t think there is any peculiar
rigidity produced by strychnia.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you never found undue rigidity in a human
subject after death by strychnia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Considerably less.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>-”In the anonymous case (the Leeds), were not the
hands curved and the feet arched by muscular contraction?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Not more than is usual in cases of death from ordinary
causes. The limbs were rigid, but not more than usual.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“In the face of the medical profession I ask you
whether you signed a report stating that ‘the hands were curved
and the feet decidedly arched by muscular contraction,’ and
whether you meant by those words that there was no more than
the ordinary rigidity of death?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Certainly; I stated so at the time.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Where? In the report?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; in conversation. Allow me to explain that a
distinction was drawn between the muscles of the different parts
of the body. I heard Mr. Morley’s evidence with regard to experiments
on animals, and his statement that ‘after death there was
an interval of flaccidity, after which rigidity commenced more than
if it had been occasioned by the usual <i>rigor mortis</i>.’”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You don’t agree with that statement?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not. I generally found the right side of the
heart full.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Does the fact of the heart in Cook’s case having
been found empty lead you to the conclusion that death was not
caused by strychnia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Among other things, it does. I heard the evidence
of Dr. Watson as to the case of Agnes Sennett, in which the heart
was found distended and empty: also of Dr. Taylor, as to the
<i>post-mortem</i> of Mrs. Smyth. No doubt he stated that the heart in
that case was also empty.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“And do those facts exercise no influence on your
judgment?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They would not unless I knew how the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination had been made. If it was commenced at the head,
the blood being fluid, the large drains would be opened, and the
blood, from natural causes, would drain away.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you know how the <i>post-mortem</i> examination was
made in this case?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. Excuse me, I do. The chest and the abdomen,
not the head, were first opened.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“The heart, then, was not emptied in the first
instance?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Then what occasioned the contraction of the heart?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“When the heart is emptied it is usually contracted.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“But how do you account for its contraction and
emptiness?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I cannot account for it.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“ Would the heart contract if there was blood
in it?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“When you find the heart contracted, you
know, then, that it was contracted at the moment of death?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is necessary to draw a distinction between the two
cavities. It is very common to find the left ventricle contracted
and hard, while the right is uncontracted.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“That is death by asphyxia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Precisely.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><i>By the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“In Cook’s case the lungs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
described as not congested. Entosthema is of two kinds; one of
them consists of dilation of the cells, the other of a rupture of the
cells. When animals die from strychnine, entosthema occurs. I do
not know the character of the entosthema in Cook’s case. It did
not occur to me to have the question put to the witnesses who
described the <i>post-mortem</i> examination.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“To what constitutional symptoms about Cook do
you ascribe the convulsions from which he died?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Not to any.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Was not the fact of his having syphilis an important
ingredient in your judgment upon his case?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It was. I judge that he died from convulsions, by
the combination of symptoms.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What evidence have you to suppose that he was
liable to excitement and depression of spirits?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The fact that after winning the race he could not
speak for three minutes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Anything else?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Mr. Jones stated that he was subject to mental
depression. Excitement will produce a state of brain which will
be followed, at some distance, by convulsions. I think Dr. Bamford
made a mistake when he said the brain was perfectly healthy.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean to set up that opinion against that
of Dr. Devonshire and Dr. Harland, who were present at the <i>post-mortem</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“My opinion is founded in part on the evidence taken
at the inquest, in part on the depositions. With the brain and the
system in the condition in which Cook’s were, I believe it is quite
possible for convulsions to come on and destroy a person. I do
not believe that he died from apoplexy. He was under the
influence of morphia. I don’t ascribe his death to morphia, except
that it might assist in producing a convulsive attack. I should
think morphia was not very good treatment, considering the state
of excitement he was in.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean to say, on your oath, that you think
he was in a state of excitement at Rugeley?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I wish to give my evidence honestly. Morphia,
when given in an injured state of the brain, often disagrees with
the patient.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“But what evidence have you as to the injured state
of the brain?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Sickness often indicates it. I can’t say whether the
attack of Sunday night was an attack of convulsions. I think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the Sunday attack was one of a similar character, but not so
intense, as the attack of Tuesday, in which he died. I don’t think
he had convulsions on the Sunday, but he was in that condition
which often precedes convulsions. I think he was mistaken when
he stated that he was awoke by a noise. I believe he was delirious.
That is one of the symptoms on which I found my opinion. Any
intestinal irritation will produce convulsions in a tetanic form. I
have known instances in children. I have not seen an instance in
an animal. Medical writers state that such cases do occur. I know
no name for convulsions of that kind.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you ever known a case of convulsions of that
kind, terminating in death, in which the patient remained conscious
to the last?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have not. Where epilepsy terminates in death
consciousness is gone. I have known four cases of <i>traumatic</i>, and
five or six of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You heard Mr. Jones make this statement of the
symptoms of Cook after the commencement of the paroxysms:&mdash;‘After
he swallowed the pills he uttered loud screams, threw himself
back in the bed, and was dreadfully convulsed. He said, “Raise
me up! I shall be suffocated.” The convulsions affected every
muscle of the body, and were accompanied by stiffening of the
limbs. I endeavoured to raise Cook with the assistance of Palmer,
but found it quite impossible owing to the rigidity of the limbs.
When Cook found we could not raise him up, he asked me to turn
him over. He was then quite sensible. I turned him on to his
side. I listened to the action of his heart. I found that it
gradually weakened, and asked Palmer to fetch some spirits of
ammonia, to be used as a stimulant. When he returned, the
pulsations of the heart were gradually ceasing, and life was almost
extinct. Cook died very quietly a very short time afterwards.
When he threw himself back in bed he clinched his hands, and they
remained clinched after death. When I was rubbing his neck, his
head and neck were unnaturally bent back by the spasmodic action
of the muscles. After death his body was so twisted or bowed that
if I had placed it upon the back it would have rested upon the
head and feet!’ Now, I ask you to distinguish in any one
particular between those symptoms and the symptoms of tetanic
convulsions.”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“<i>It is not tetanus at all; not idiopathic tetanus.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“I quite agree with you that it was not <i>idiopathic
tetanus</i>. But point out any distinction that you can see between
these symptoms and real <i>tetanus</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not know that there is any distinction, except
that in a case of <i>tetanus</i> I never saw rigidity continue till death
and afterwards.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you tell me of any case of death from convulsions
in which the patient was conscious to the last?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not know any. Convulsions occurring after
poison has been taken are properly called tetanic.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Sir B. Brodie tells us that while paroxysms of
tetanic convulsion last there is no difference between those that
arise from strychnia and those from <i>tetanus</i> properly so called,
but only in the course the symptoms take. What do you say is
the difference?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The hands are less violently contracted; the effect
of the spasm is less in ordinary <i>tetanus</i>; the convulsion, too, never
entirely passes away. I have stated that <i>tetanus</i> is a disease of
days, strychnia of hours and minutes; that convulsive twitchings
are in <i>strychnia</i> the first symptoms, the last in <i>tetanus</i>; that in
<i>tetanus</i> the hands, feet, and legs are usually the last affected, while
in <i>strychnia</i> they are the first. I gave that opinion after the
symptoms in the case of the lady at Leeds which were described
by the witness Witham, and I still adhere to it. I never said that
Cook’s was a case of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i> in any sense of the word.
It differed from the course of <i>tetanus</i> from strychnine in the particulars
I have already mentioned.”</p>

<p><i>The Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Repeat them.”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There was a sudden accession of the convulsions.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Sudden&mdash;after what?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“After the rousing by Jones. There was also the
power of talking.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Don’t you know that Mrs. Smyth talked and retained
her consciousness to the end: that her last words were,
‘Turn me over’?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“She did say something of that kind. No doubt those
were the words she used. I believe that in poison <i>tetanus</i> the
symptoms are first observed in the legs and feet. In the animals
upon which I have experimented twitchings in the ears and difficulty
of breathing have been premonitory symptoms.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“When Cook felt a stiffness and difficulty of breathing,
and said that he should be suffocated on the first night, what
were they but premonitory symptoms?” (<i>question evaded</i>).</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Well, he asked to be rubbed; but as far as my experience
goes with regard to animals&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“They can’t ask to have their ears rubbed,
of course.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“The witness was about to explain the effect
of being rubbed upon animals.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“In no single instance could the animals bear to be
touched.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did not Mrs. Smyth ask to have her arms and legs
rubbed?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“In the Leeds case the lady asked to be rubbed before
the convulsions came on, but afterwards she could not bear it, and
begged not to be touched.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you point out any one point, after the premonitory
symptoms, in which the symptoms in this case differ
from those of strychnia <i>tetanus</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There is the power of swallowing, which is taken
away by inability to move the jaw.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“But have you not stated that lockjaw is the last
symptom in strychnia <i>tetanus</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have. I don’t deny that it may be. I am speaking
of the general rule. In the Leeds case it came on very early,
more than two hours before death, the paroxysms having continued
for two and a half hours. In that case we believed the dose was
four times repeated. Poison might probably be extracted by
chemical process from the tissues, but I never tried it except in the
case of one animal. I am not sure whether poison was in that case
given through the mouth. We killed four animals in reference to
the Leeds case, and in every instance we found strychnia in the
contents of the stomach. In one case we administered it by two
processes&mdash;one failed, and the other succeeded.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i>&mdash;“In making reports on cases such as that referred
to (Leeds) we state ordinary appearances as well as extraordinary&mdash;facts
without anything more.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. William Herapath, examined by Mr. Grove, Q. C.</i>&mdash;“I am a
professor of chemistry and toxicology at the Bristol Medical School&mdash;have
studied chemistry for more than forty years&mdash;toxicology for
thirty. Have experimented on strychnia; have seen no case of a
human subject during life, but have examined a human body after
death. In one case I examined the contents of the stomach, and
found strychnia three days after death. I obtained evidence of
strychnia by the colour tests in that case. I have experimented on
animals for strychnia in eight or nine cases, and analysed the bodies
in two cases where I destroyed the animals myself&mdash;both cats. I
gave the first one grain of strychnia in a solid form. The animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
took the poison at night, and I found it dead in the morning. It
was dreadfully contorted and rigid, the limbs extended, the head
turned round&mdash;not to the back, to the side&mdash;the eyes protruding
and staring, the iris expanded so as to be almost invisible. I found
strychnia in the urine which had been ejected, and also in the
stomach, by the test I mentioned. I administered the same
quantity of strychnia in a solid form to another cat. It remained
very quiet for fifteen or twenty minutes, but seemed a little restless
in the eyes and its breathing. In thirty-five minutes it had a
terrible spasm, the extremities and the head being drawn together
and the feet extended. I watched it for three hours. The first
spasm lasted a minute or two. The saliva dropped from its mouth,
and it forcibly ejected its urine. It had a second spasm a few
minutes afterwards. It soon recovered and remained still,
with the exception of a trembling all over. It continued in that
state three hours. During two hours and a half it was in a very
peculiar state. It appeared to be electrified all through; blowing
upon it or touching the basket in which it was placed produced a
kind of electric jump like a galvanic shock. I left it in three
hours, thinking it would recover, but in the morning I found it
dead, in the same indurated and contorted condition as the former
animal. I examined the body thirty-six hours after death and
found strychnia in the urine, in the stomach and in the upper
intestine, in the liver, and in the blood of the heart. I have discovered
strychnia in all other cases by the same tests, but I took
extraordinary means to get rid of organic matter. <i>In all cases in
which strychnia has been given I have been able to find it, but not only
strychnia, but the nux vomica from which it is taken.</i> I have found
nux vomica in a fox and other animals. The detection of nux
vomica is more complicated than that of strychnia. In one case
the animal had been buried two months. <i>I have experimented with
strychnia mixed purposely with organic putrefying matter. I have found
it in all cases, whatever was the state of decomposition of the matter.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“<i>Are you of opinion that where strychnia has been
taken in a sufficient dose to poison it can and ought to be discovered?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“<i>Yes; unless the body has been completely decomposed&mdash;that
is, unless decomposition had reduced it to a dry powder. I am
of opinion, from the accounts given by Dr. Taylor and the other witnesses,
that if it had existed in the body of Cook it ought to have been
discovered. I am aware of no cause of error in the analysis, if the
organic matter had been properly got rid of.</i> The experiments I
made were in Bristol. I have made experiments in London, and
found strychnia in the stomach, liver, and blood of an animal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“I don’t profess to be a
toxicologist. I have principally experimented on the stomach till
lately. I tried my chemical process on the 8th of this month
with a view to the present case. The experiment here was on a
dog. I experimented on the tissues of a cat at Bristol, and a dog
in London. I found strychnia in the blood, the heart, and the
urine of the cat, besides the stomach. One grain was given to the
dog. It was a large dog. I have seen a cat killed with a quarter
of a grain.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“<i>Have you not said, that you had no doubt strychnia
had been taken, but that Dr. Taylor had not gone the right way to
find it?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; certainly not.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you not said it to the present Mayor of
Bristol?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have said, if it was there Dr. Taylor ought to
have found it.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you not said several times in his presence
that you had no doubt strychnia had been given, but that
Dr. Taylor had not found it?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I had a strong opinion from the reports in the
newspapers; it is very likely I might. I don’t deny it.”</p>

<p><i>To Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“From the statements I saw in the newspapers:
I was not engaged in the case, and I conceived I had
a right to express an opinion, the same as others. I dare
say I have frequently said so in conversation. Hundreds of
persons spoke to me, knowing I had made toxicology a study, and
it is possible I may have said something like what you ask me
about.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><i>Re-examined by Mr. Grove.</i>&mdash;“What is the smallest quantity of
strychnia that your process is capable of detecting?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“<i>I am perfectly sure I could detect the 50,000th part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a grain if it was unmixed with organic matter. If I put ten grains
in a gallon, or 70,000 grains of water, I could discover its presence
in the tenth part of a grain of that water.</i> It is more difficult to
detect when mixed with organic matter. If a person had taken a
grain, a very small quantity would be found in the heart, but no
doubt it could be found. I made four experiments with a large
dog to which I had given the one-eighth part of a grain. <i>I have
discovered it by change of colour in the thirty-second part of the
liver of a dog.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In reply to a request by Mr. Grove, Lord Campbell intimated
that in the opinion of the Court experiments could not
now be shown. This defect of evidence has been cured by
the Vivisection Act, before referred to.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Henry Letheby, examined by Mr. Kenealy.</i>&mdash;“I am a bachelor
of medicine, professor of chemistry and toxicology in the London
Hospital of Medicine, and Medical Officer of Health to the City of
London. I have been engaged for a considerable time in the study
of poisons and their action on the living animal economy. I have
also been frequently engaged on behalf of the Crown in prosecutions
in cases of this nature during the last fourteen years. I
have been present during the examination of the medical witnesses,
and have attended to the evidence as to the symptoms
which have been described as attending the death of Cook. I
have witnessed many cases of animals poisoned by strychnia, and
many cases of poisoning by nux vomica in the human body, one
of which was fatal. The symptoms described in this case do not
accord with the symptoms I have witnessed in the case of those
animals. They differ in this respect:&mdash;In the first place I never
witnessed the long interval between the administration of the
poison and the commencement of the symptoms which is said to
have elapsed in this case. The longest interval I have known has
been three-quarters of an hour, and then the poison was administered
under most disadvantageous circumstances. It was given
on a very full stomach and in a form uneasy of solution. I have
seen the symptoms begin in five minutes. The average time in
which they begin is a quarter of an hour. In all cases I have seen
the system has been in that irritable state that the very lightest
excitement, such as an effort to move, a touch, a noise, a breath of
air, would send the patient off in convulsions. It is not at all probable
that a person, after taking strychnia, could pull a bell violently.
Any movement would excite the nervous system, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
bring on spasms. It is not likely that a person in that state
could bear to have his neck rubbed. When a case of strychnia
does not end fatally, the first paroxysm is succeeded by others,
gradually shaded off, the paroxysms becoming less violent every
time, and I agree with Dr. Christison that they would subside in
twelve or sixteen hours. I have no hesitation in saying that
strychnia is, of all poisons, either mineral or vegetable, the most
easy of detection. I have detected it in the stomach of animals in
numerous instances, also in the blood and in the tissues. The
longest period after death in which I have detected it is about a
month. The animal was then in a state of decomposition. I have
detected very minute portions of strychnia. When it is pure, the
20,000th part of a grain can be detected. I can detect the tenth
part of a grain most easily in a pint of any liquid, whether pure or
putrid. I gave one animal half a grain, and I have the strychnia
here now within a very small trifle. I never failed to detect
strychnia where it had been administered. I have made <i>post-mortem</i>
examinations on various animals killed by it. I have
always found the right side of the heart full. The reason is that
the death takes place from the fixing of the muscles of the chest
by spasms, so that the blood is unable to pass through the lungs,
and the heart cannot relieve itself from the blood flowing to it,
and therefore becomes gorged. The lungs are congested and filled
with blood. I have administered strychnia in a liquid and a solid
form; I agree with Dr. Taylor that it may kill in six or eleven
minutes when taken in a solid state in the form of a pill or bolus.
I also agree with him that the first symptom is that the animal
falls on its side, the jaws are spasmodically closed, and the
slightest touch produces another paroxysm. But I do not agree
with him that the colour tests are fallacious. I do not agree
that it is changed when it is absorbed into the blood, but I agree
with its absorption. I think it is not changed when the body is
decomposed. The shaking about of the contents of the stomach
with the intestines in a jar, would not prevent the discovery of
strychnia, if it had been administered. Even if the contents of
the stomach were lost, the mucous membrane would, in the ordinary
course of things, exhibit traces of strychnia. I have studied
the poison of antimony. If a quantity had been introduced into
brandy-and-water, and swallowed at a gulp, the effect would not be
to burn the throat. Antimony does not possess any such quality
as that of immediate burning. I have turned my attention to the
subject of poison for seventeen or eighteen years.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“I am not a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the College of Physicians or of Surgeons. I do not now practise.
I have been in general practice for two or three years. <i>I
gave evidence in the last case of this sort, tried in this court in 1850</i>”
(the case of Ann Merritt). “<i>I gave evidence of the presence of
arsenic. The woman was convicted. I stated that it had been administered
within four hours of death. I was the cause of her being
respited, and the sentence was not carried into effect, in consequence of
a letter I wrote to the Home Office. Other scientific gentlemen interfered,
and challenged the soundness of my conclusions before I wrote
that letter. I have not since been employed by the Crown. There has
not been a case that I know of. I have been employed in prosecutions.</i>”</p>

<p><i>By Mr. Justice Cresswell.</i>&mdash;“I was present at the trial. I perfectly
remember it.” (See the report of this case, <i>post</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Cross-examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I detected the poison. I said in
my letter that I could not speak as to possibilities, but merely as
to probabilities. I have experimented on animals for a great number
of years. On five recently. I have never given more than a
grain, and it has always been in a solid form&mdash;in pills or bread.
In the case where poison was administered under disadvantageous
circumstances it was kneaded up into a hard mass of bread.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Baron Alderson.</i>&mdash;“Did the animal bolt it or bite it?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I opened the mouth and put it into the throat.
About half an hour elapsed before the symptoms appeared in one
case in which half a grain had been given. In another case death
took place within thirteen minutes. I have noticed twitching of
the ears, difficulty of breathing, and other premonitory symptoms.
There are little variations in the order in which the symptoms
occur. I have known frequent instances in which an animal has
died in the first paroxysm. I heard the evidence of Mrs. Smyth’s
death, and I was surprised at her having got out of bed when the
servant answered the bell. It is not consistent with the cases I
have seen. That fact does not shake my opinion. I have no
doubt that Mrs. Smyth died from strychnia. Cook’s sitting up
in bed and asking Jones to ring the bell is inconsistent with what
I have observed in strychnia cases.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“If a man’s breath is hurried, is it not natural for
him to sit up?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is. I have seen cases of recovery of human
subjects after taking strychnia. There is a great uniformity in
its effects; that is, in their main features, but there is a small
variation as to the time in which they are produced.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What do you attribute Cook’s death to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is irreconcileable with everything with which I am
acquainted.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is it reconcileable with any known disease you have
ever seen or heard of?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><i>Re-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“We are learning new facts
every day, and I do not at present conceive it to be impossible
that some peculiarity of the spinal cord, unrecognisable at the
examination after death, may have produced symptoms like those
which have been described. I, of course, include strychnia in my
answer, but it is irreconcileable with everything I have seen or
heard of. It is as irreconcileable with everything else; it is
irreconcileable with every disease that I am acquainted with,
natural or artificial. Touching an animal during the premonitory
symptoms will bring on a paroxysm. Vomiting is inconsistent with
strychnia. The Romsey case was an exceptional one, from the
quantity of the dose. The ringing of the bell would have produced
a paroxysm. I am still of opinion that the evidence I gave
on the trial in 1851 is correct. I am not aware that there is any
ground for an imputation upon me in respect of that evidence.
I have no reason to think Government was dissatisfied with
me. <i>I have been since employed in prosecutions, where I very much
think the Crown was the prosecutor. After that case Dr. Pereira
came to my laboratory, and asked me, as an act of mercy, to write a
letter to him to show to the Home Office, admitting the possibility of the
poison which I found in the stomach having been administered longer
than four hours before death. I wrote the letter, drawing a distinction
between what was possible and probable, and the woman was transported
for life.</i>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In addition to these analytical chemists, Professor Rogers,
of the St. George’s Medical School, London, described an
experiment he had lately made on a dog to which he had
given two grains of strychnia. He had not taken out its
stomach and its contents, together with some of the blood,
until three days after death, and had put off the analysis of
the latter for <i>ten</i> days, when it had become putrid, and that
of the stomach and its contents for a month or five weeks, yet
found in both portions strychnia in large quantities. This
witness maintained that unless the contents of the stomach in
Cook’s case had been lost, their being shaken would only
make the process of detection more difficult, but admitted
that if strychnia had been in his stomach it would be found
smeared over its mucous membrane, which, it may be
remembered, was not sent to Dr. Taylor.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Francis Wrightson</i>, a pupil of Liebig, of Giessen, a
teacher of chemistry at a school in Birmingham, described
two similar experiments on animals, with the same results
as Professor Rogers. He expressed his decided opinion
that strychnia could be detected in a mixture of bile,
bilious matter, and putrifying blood and in the tissues in
extremely minute quantities indeed, and that five or six days
after death he should expect to find it, if it had been given&mdash;unless
the dose had been entirely absorbed. The clearness
and decision with which this witness gave his evidence
elicited the well-deserved commendation of Lord Campbell.
On <i>cross-examination</i> by the <i>Attorney-General</i>, he was
asked&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing that the whole dose was absorbed into
the system, where would you expect to find it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“In the blood.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Does it pass from the blood into the solids of the
body?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It does, or I should rather say it is left in the solids
of the body. In its progress towards its final destination, the
destruction of life, it passes from the blood, or is left by the blood
in the solid tissues of the body.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“If it be present in the stomach, you find it in the
stomach; if it be present in the blood, you find it there; if left
by the blood in the tissues, you find it there?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Precisely so.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Suppose the whole had been absorbed.”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Then I would not undertake to find it.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Suppose the whole had been eliminated from the
blood, and had passed into the urine, should you expect to find it
in the blood?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Certainly not.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Suppose the minimum dose which will destroy life
had been taken, and absorbed into the circulation, then deposited
in the tissues, and then a part eliminated by the action of the
kidneys; where would you search for it?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“In the blood, in the tissues, and in the ejections;
and I would undertake to discover it in each of them.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Partridge</i>, the professor of Anatomy at King’s College,
gave the following evidence, attributing the death of Cook to
the granules found on his spine at the <i>post-mortem</i> examination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“These granules,” said the witness, “would be likely to
cause inflammation, and no doubt that inflammation would have
been discovered if the spinal cord or its membranes had been
examined shortly after death. It would not be likely to be
discovered if the spinal cord was not examined until nine weeks
after death. I have not seen cases in which this inflammation has
produced tetanic form of convulsions, but such cases are on record.
It sometimes does, and sometimes does not produce convulsions
and death.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you form any judgment as to the cause of death
in Cook’s case?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I cannot. No conclusion or inference can be drawn
from the degree or kind of the contractions of the body after
death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“Can you not say from the symptoms you
heard whether death was produced by <i>tetanus</i>, without saying what
was the cause of <i>tetanus</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Hypothetically I should infer that he died of the
form of <i>tetanus</i> which convulses the muscles. Great varieties of
rigidity arise after death from natural causes. The half-bent
hands and fingers are not uncommon after natural death. The
arching of the feet in this case seemed to me rather greater than
usual.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Granules are sometimes,
but not commonly, found about the spine of a healthy
subject,&mdash;not on the cord itself; they may exist consistently with
health. No satisfactory cases of the inflammation I have described
have come under my notice without producing convulsions. It is
a very rare disease. I cannot state from the recorded cases the
course of the symptoms of that disease. It varies in duration,
sometimes lasting only for days, sometimes much longer. If the
patient lives it is accompanied with paralysis. It produces no effect
on the brain which is recognisable after death. It would not affect
the brain prior to death. I do not know whether it is attended
with loss of sensibility before death. The size of the granules which
will produce it varies. This disease is not a matter of months,
unless it terminates in palsy. I never heard of a case in which the
patient died after a single convulsion. Between the intervals of
the convulsions I don’t believe a man could have twenty-four hours’
repose. Pain and spasms would accompany the convulsions. I
cannot form a judgment as to whether the general health would be
affected in the intervals between them.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You have heard it stated that from the midnight of
Monday till Tuesday Cook had complete repose. Now, I ask you,
in the face of the medical profession, whether you think the symptoms
which have been described proceeded from that disease?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I should think not.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did you ever know the hands completely clinched
after death except in case of tetanus?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you ever known it even in <i>idiopathic</i> or <i>traumatic
tetanus</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have never seen <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>. I have seen
the hands completely clinched in <i>traumatic tetanus</i>. A great deal
of force is often required to separate them.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you ever known the feet so distorted as to
assume the form of a club foot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You heard Mr. Jones state that if he had turned
the body upon the back it would have rested on the head and the
heels. Have you any doubt that that is an indication of death from
tetanus?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; it is a form of tetanic spasm. I am only acquainted
with <i>tetanus</i> resulting from strychnia by reading. Some
of the symptoms in Cook’s case are consistent, some are inconsistent
with strychnia <i>tetanus</i>. The first inconsistent symptom is the
intervals that occurred between the taking of the supposed poison
and the attacks.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are not symptoms of bending of the body, difficulty
of respiration, convulsions in the throat, legs, and arms, perfectly
consistent with what you know of the symptoms of death from
strychnia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Perfectly consistent. I have known cases of <i>traumatic
tetanus</i>. The symptoms in those cases had been occasionally
remitted, never wholly terminated. I never knew <i>traumatic
tetanus</i> run its course to death in less than three or four days. I
never knew a complete case of the operation of strychnia upon a
human subject.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Bearing in mind the distinction between <i>traumatic</i>
and <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>, did you ever know of such a death as that
of Cook according to the symptoms you have heard described?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined by Mr. Grove.</i>&mdash;“Besides the symptom which I have
mentioned as being inconsistent with the theory of death by
strychnia, there are others&mdash;namely, sickness, beating the bed
clothes, want of sensitiveness to external impressions, and sudden
cessation of the convulsions and apparent complete recovery.
There was apparently an absence of the usual muscular agitation.
Symptoms of convulsive character arising from an injury to the
spine vary considerably in their degrees of violence, in their periods
of intermission, and in the muscles which are attacked. Intermission
of the disease occurs, but is not frequent in <i>traumatic
tetanus</i>. I don’t remember that death has ever taken place in
fifteen hours; it may take place in forty-eight hours during
convulsions. Granules about the spine are more unusual in young
people than in old. I don’t know of any case in which the spine
can preserve its integrity, so as to be properly examined, for a
period of nine weeks. I should not feel justified in inferring that
there was no disease from not finding any at the end of that time.
The period of decomposition varies from a few hours to a few days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
It is not in the least probable that it could be delayed for nine
weeks.”</p>

<p><i>By the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Supposing the stomach were acted
on by other causes, I do not think sickness would be inconsistent
with <i>tetanus</i>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">With reference to the existence of these granules, <i>Mr.
Oliver Pemberton</i>, anatomical lecturer at Queen’s College,
Birmingham, who was present with Professor Bolton when
Cook’s body was exhumed, in January, for the special purpose
of arriving at a more satisfactory decision on this point than
had been effected at the first <i>post-mortem</i> examination, was
called for the defence. He gave it as his opinion, in which
Professor Bolton agreed, that the spinal cord was not then in
a condition to enable him to judge as to what was its state
immediately after death; the upper part, where it separated
from the brain, being green from decomposition, and the
other part, though better preserved, not soft enough for that
purpose. This point was, therefore, left in a far from satisfactory
position.</p>

<p>A <i>Dr. G. Robinson</i>, of the Newcastle-on-Tyne Dispensary,
also supported the spinal granules theory, and considered
that from his habits of life Cook was predisposed to epilepsy.
He admitted, however, on <i>cross-examination</i>, that “he had
never seen symptoms of epilepsy proceed to anything like
the extent as in Cook’s case; never saw a body so stiff in
epilepsy as to rest on its head and heels; nor such symptoms,
except in tetanus, and that the extreme form of epilepsy was
always accompanied by unconsciousness.” “The granules,”
he thought, “were likely to have irritated the spinal cord, and
yet no indications remain after death; they might have
produced Cook’s death.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“But do you think so?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Putting aside the assumption of strychnia, I should
say so.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“<i>Are not all the symptoms reported by
Mr. Jones indicative of death by strychnia?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>They certainly are.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Then it comes to this, that if there were
no other cause of death suggested, you should say it arose from
epilepsy?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes. Epilepsy is a well-known disease which includes
many others, and the convulsions of that disease sometimes assume
tetanic appearances.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The last important medical witness called for the defence,
<i>Dr. Benjamin Ward Richardson</i>, physician, of London, took
the prosecution somewhat by surprise by attributing Cook’s
death to <i>Angina pectoris</i>, a cause not as yet hinted at. As
the counsel for the Crown were not prepared with information
requisite for an effective <i>cross-examination</i> on this point, at
the close of the prisoner’s case the Attorney-General asked
leave to recall this witness, as he was then prepared with the
books required for that purpose. The Court, however, refused
the application, and the evidence therefore must be accepted
with caution.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Richardson</i> said:&mdash;“I am a physician, practising in London.
I have never seen a case of <i>tetanus</i>, properly so called, but I have
seen many cases of death by convulsions. In many instances
they have presented tetanic appearances without being strictly
tetanus. I have seen the muscles fixed, especially those of the
upper part of the body. I have observed the arms stiffened out,
and the hands closely and firmly clinched until death. I have
also observed a sense of suffocation in the patient. In some forms
of convulsions I have seen contortions both of the legs and the
feet, and the patient generally expresses a wish to sit up. I have
known persons die of a disease called angina pectoris. The
symptoms of that disease, I consider, resemble closely those of
Mr. Cook. Angina pectoris comes under the denomination of
spasmodic diseases. In some cases the disease is detectable upon
<i>post-mortem</i> examination; in others it is not. I attended one case.
A girl ten years old was under my care in 1850. I supposed she
had suffered from scarlet fever. She recovered so far that my
visits ceased. I left her amused and merry in the morning; at
half-past ten in the evening I was called in to see her, and I found
her dying. She was supported upright at her own request, her
face was pale, the muscles of the face rigid, the arms rigid, the
fingers clinched, the respiratory muscles completely fixed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
rigid, and with all this there was combined intense agony and
restlessness, such as I have never witnessed. There was perfect
consciousness. The child knew me, described her agony, and
eagerly took some brandy and water from a spoon. I left for the
purpose of obtaining some chloroform from my own house, which
was thirty yards distant. When I returned her head was drawn
back, and I could detect no respiration; the eyes were then fixed
open, and the body just resembled a statue; she was dead. On
the following day I made a <i>post-mortem</i> examination. The brain
was slightly congested; the upper part of the spinal cord seemed
healthy; the lungs were collapsed; the heart was in such a state
of firm spasm and solidity, and so emptied of blood, that I remarked
that it might have been rinsed out. I could not discover any appearance
of disease that would account for the death, except a slight
effusion of serum in one pleural cavity. I never could ascertain any
cause for the death. The child went to bed well and merry, and
immediately afterwards jumped up, screamed, and exclaimed, ‘I am
going to die.’”</p>

<p><i>By the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“I consider that the symptoms I
have described were those of angina pectoris. It is the opinion of
Dr. Jenner that this disease is occasioned by the ossification of
some of the small vessels of the heart. I did not find that to be
the case in this instance. There have been many cases where no
cause whatever was discovered. It is called angina pectoris, from
its causing such extreme anguish to the chest. I do not think the
symptoms I have described were such as would result from taking
strychnia. There is this difference,&mdash;that rubbing the hands gives
ease to the patient in cases of angina pectoris. I must say there
would be great difficulty in detecting the difference in cases of
angina pectoris and strychnia. As regards symptoms I know of
no difference between the two. I am bound to say that if I had
known so much of these subjects as I do now, in the case I have
referred to I should have gone on to analysis to endeavour to
detect strychnia. In the second case I discovered organic disease
of the heart, which was quite sufficient to account for the symptoms.
The disease of angina pectoris comes on quite suddenly, and does
not give any notice of its approach. I did not send any note of
this case to any medical publication. It is not at all an uncommon
occurrence to find the hands firmly clinched after death in cases of
natural disease.”</p>

<p><i>By Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“There are cases of angina pectoris in
which the patient has recovered and appeared perfectly well for a
period of twenty-four hours, and then the attack has returned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
I am of opinion that the fact of the recurrence of the second fit in
Cook’s case is more the symptom of angina pectoris than of strychnia
poison.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><i>Dr. Wrightson</i> was recalled, and in answer to a question put by
Mr. Serjeant Shee he said it was his opinion that when the strychnia
poison was absorbed in the system it was diffused throughout the
entire system.</p>

<p><i>By the Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“The longer time that elapsed before
the death would render the absorption more complete. If a
minimum dose to destroy life were given, and a long interval
elapsed to the death, the more complete would be the absorption
and the less the chance of finding it in the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>By Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“I should expect still to find it in the
spleen and liver and blood.”</p></div>

<p class="psh">CASES OF <i>TETANUS</i> BROUGHT FORWARD FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>In answer to the cases of undoubted poisoning by strychnia
proved on the part of the prosecution, four cases of <i>tetanus</i>
were brought forward on behalf of the prisoner, with the
object of showing that the symptoms then exhibited were
identical with those in Cook’s case, and, therefore, raising the
presumption that he might have died from ordinary tetanic
convulsions, and not from those produced by strychnia.</p>

<p>The first of these cases was described by <i>Mr. Robert
Edward Gay</i>, a member of the College of Surgeons, who had
attended a patient of the name of <i>Forster</i> for <i>tetanus</i> in
October, 1855. Apparently, at first the patient was suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
only from sore throat and its usual attendant pains in the
neck and upper portion of the spine, for which he was duly
treated. On the fourth day of his illness the muscular pains
extended to the face, and particularly to the lower jaw, and by
evening lockjaw had come on, with pains of the muscles of the
bowels, legs, and arms. “He became very convulsed throughout
the entire muscular system, had frequent involuntary
contractions of the arms, hands, and legs; his difficulty of
swallowing increased, and not a particle of food, solid or
liquid, could be introduced into the mouth, the attempt to do
so bringing on violent convulsions; so strong were they, that
I could compare him to nothing but a piece of warped board.”
The head was thrown back, the abdomen thrust forward, the
legs frequently drawn up and contracted; the attempt to feed
him with a spoon, the opening a window, or placing the fingers
on the pulse, brought on violent convulsions. While the
patient was suffering in this manner, he complained of great
hunger, repeatedly exclaimed that he was hungry, and could
not eat. He was kept alive <i>to the fourteenth day</i> entirely by
injections of a milky and farinaceous character. He was insensible
on the 12th, and continued so till he died. There
was no sore or hurt about his body, and Mr. Gay attributed
his death to an inflammatory sore throat, from cold and
exposure to the weather, assuming a tetanic form, from the
patient being a very nervous, excited, and anxious person.
Mr. Gay, whilst satisfied that this was a case of <i>idiopathic
tetanus</i>, admitted that he never met with such another case;
that it was altogether progressive from the first onset; that
although for a short time there was a remission of symptoms,
they invariably recurred, and that the locking of the jaw was
the very first symptom that made its appearance.</p>

<p>In another case, at the Royal Free Hospital, in 1843, on
the 28th of July, a boy was brought in with the middle toe of
his left foot smashed by a stone, which Mr. John Gay amputated.
The accident had happened a week before, and the
wound became very unhealthy. When the surgeon first saw
him, his mouth was almost closed, and continued so until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
1st of August, but a small quantity of medicine could be
introduced.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“During the first three days,” said <i>Mr. J. Gay</i>, “his paroxysms
were of unusual severity; he complained of a stiff neck, and during
the first night started up and was convulsed. On the following
night he was again convulsed. At times the abdominal muscles,
as well as those of the legs and back, were rigid, and the muscles
of the face in a state of great contraction. He was in the same
state the next day, but at two o’clock there was much less rigidity
of the muscles, especially those of the abdomen and back. On the
following morning the rigidity had gone, he opened his mouth and
could talk; he was thoroughly relieved. He had no return of
spasms till half-past five on the following day. He then asked the
nurse to change his linen, and as she lifted him up in bed to do so,
violent convulsions of the arms and face came on, and he died in a
few minutes. About thirty hours elapsed between the preceding
convulsion and the one which ended his life. Before the paroxysm
came on the rigidity had been completely relaxed. Tartar emetic
(containing antimony), which I gave on the second and third day,
did not produce vomiting; the rigidity of the muscles of the chest
would go far to prevent it. The wound might have rubbed against
the bed when he was raised, but I don’t think it possible. Some
peculiar irritation of the nerves would give rise to the affection of
the spinal cord. There may be various causes for this irritation of
the spinal cord, which ends in <i>tetanus</i>, but it would be very difficult
merely from seeing symptoms of <i>tetanus</i>, and in the absence of
knowledge of how it had been occasioned, to ascribe it to any
particular cause. No doubt the death took place in consequence
of something produced by the injury of the toe.”</p>

<p class="p1">The seriousness of the wound in this case, in comparison
with any signs of wounds found on Cook’s body, and the
severity of the shock occasioned by such a painful accident,
renders this example almost valueless.</p>

<p>In a third case, at the London Hospital, on the 22nd of
March of 1856, a patient, aged thirty-seven, was brought in
about half-past seven in the evening. When in the receiving
room, he had one paroxysm, and another soon after when in
the ward. After the first, his pulse was feeble and rapid, his
jaws closed and fixed, an expression of anxiety on his countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and his features sunken; he was unable to swallow,
and the muscles of the abdomen and the back were somewhat
tense. After the second paroxysm, his body became arched
for about a minute. He was quieter for a few minutes, had a
third attack, and died. He had some old neglected sores of a
chronic character, particularly at the right elbow, a peculiarly
sensitive spot, and Mr. Ross, the house-surgeon, who attended
the case, admitted that the disease had been coming on since
the morning, that he had felt symptoms of lockjaw at
breakfast, and had had successive attacks all the afternoon
before coming to the hospital. Here again the case had been
progressive until death, and commenced with lockjaw, the
admitted signs of ordinary tetanus as distinguished from that
due to poison.</p>

<p>The last case proved was that of <i>Catherine Wilson</i>, of
Garnkirk, near Glasgow, who “was attacked with a fit,” as
she deposed, “in October last year at night, felt heavy all the
day from the morning, but had no pain till night. My first
pain,” she said, “was in the stomach, and then I had cramp
in the arm, and became quite insensible.” By the administration
of chloroform the spasms were relieved, and she
recovered.</p>

<p><i>Dr. William Macdonald</i>, of Edinburgh, who saw the case
about an hour after the attack, admitted that lockjaw came on
in about an hour or two after he was called in.</p>

<p>This witness was also put forward as a medical expert in
cases of strychnia, and attributed Cook’s death to “epileptic
convulsions with tetanic complications,” and was subjected to
the following <i>cross-examination</i> by the <i>Attorney-General</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I believe,” said <i>Dr. Macdonald</i>, “that all convulsive diseases,
including the epileptic forms and the various tetanic complications,
arise from the decomposition of the blood acting upon the nerves.
Any mental excitement might have caused Cook’s death. Cook
was excited at Shrewsbury, and whenever there is excitement there
is a consequent depression. I think Cook was afterwards depressed.
When a man is lying in bed and vomiting he must be
depressed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“This gentleman was much overjoyed at
his horse winning, and you think he vomited in consequence?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It might predispose him to vomit.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“I am not speaking of ‘mights.’ Do you
think that the excitement of three minutes on the course on
Tuesday accounts for the vomiting on Wednesday night.?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I do not. I find no symptoms of excitement or
depression reported between that time and his death. The white
spots found in the stomach of the deceased might, by producing an
inflammatory condition of the stomach, have brought on the convulsions
that caused death.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“But the gentlemen who made the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination say that the stomach was not inflamed.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“There were white spots, which cannot exist without
inflammation. There must have been inflammation.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“But these gentlemen say there was not.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I do not believe them. Sexual excitement might
cause epileptic convulsions with tetanic complications. The chancre
and syphilitic sores were evidence that Cook had undergone
such excitement. That might have occurred before he was at
Shrewsbury.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Might sexual excitement produce epilepsy
a fortnight after it occurred?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“There is an instance on record in which epilepsy
supervened upon the very act of intercourse.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Have you any instance in which epilepsy
came on a fortnight afterwards?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It is within the range of possibility.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean as a serious man of science to
say so?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The results might.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“What results were there in this case?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The chancre and the syphilitic sores.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Did you ever hear of a chancre causing
epilepsy?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Did you ever dream of such a thing.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I never heard of it.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Did you ever hear of any other form of
syphilitic disease producing epilepsy?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No; but <i>tetanus</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“But you say that this was epilepsy. We are
not talking of <i>tetanus</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“You forget the tetanic complication.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“If I understand it right then, the sexual
excitement produces epilepsy, and the chancre superadds tetanic
complications.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I say the results of sexual excitement produce
epilepsy.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“What would be the effect of morphia given
a day or two previously; would it not retard the action of the
poison?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No. I have seen opium bring on convulsions very
nearly similar.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“What quantity?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“A grain and a half. From my experience, I think if
morphia had been given a day or two before, it would have
accelerated the action of the strychnia. If this were a case of
poisoning by strychnia, I should suppose that as both opium and
strychnia produce congestion of the brain, they would act together
and have a more speedy effect. If congestion of the brain was
coming on when morphia was given to Cook on the Sunday and
Monday nights it might have increased rather than allayed it.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“But the gentlemen who examined the body
say there was no congestion after death.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“But Dr. Bamford says there was.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“You stick to Dr. Bamford.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes; because he was a man of experience and could
judge much better than younger men, and was not so likely to be
mistaken.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“But Dr. Bamford says that Cook died of
apoplexy. Do you think it was apoplexy?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No; it was not.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“What then do you think of Dr. Bamford, who
certified that it was?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“That was a matter of opinion, but the existence of
congestion on the brain he saw.”</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“The other medical men said there was
none.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“That is rather a matter of reasoning than of
evidence.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Having thus reported the medico-scientific evidence <i>pro</i>
and <i>con</i>, we pass on to the moral evidence&mdash;the purchase of
poison by the prisoner, and his acts during Cook’s illness and
subsequent to his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">PURCHASE OF POISON BY PALMER.</p>

<p>The proof that Palmer purchased strychnia on two separate
occasions immediately before the convulsive attacks of which
Cook died rested on the evidence of two druggists’ assistants
at Rugeley. One of these, <i>Charles Newton</i>, assistant to
<i>Mr. Salt</i>, swore that about nine o’clock on the Monday
evening, the 19th of November, Palmer came to his master’s
shop, asked for three grains of strychnia, which he gave
him, without charge, as he knew him as a medical practitioner
of the town. Next morning, between eleven and
twelve, <i>Roberts</i>, the assistant of <i>Hawkins</i>, another druggist in
Rugeley, was asked by Palmer for two drachms of prussic
acid, for which he brought a bottle with him. Whilst <i>Roberts</i>
was preparing this, <i>Newton</i>, the former witness, came into
the shop, and Palmer, putting his hand on <i>Newton’s</i> shoulder,
said he wished to speak with him, and together they stepped
out into the street, when Palmer asked some questions about
Mr. Edwin Salt going to a farm about fourteen miles from
Rugeley. Whilst they were talking, a <i>Mr. Brassington</i> joined
them, and began to speak to <i>Newton</i> about some accounts for
Mr. Salt, on which Palmer went back into Hawkins’s shop and
asked for six grains of strychnia and two drachms of Batley’s
solution of opium.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Whilst I was preparing them,” said <i>Roberts</i>, “Palmer stood at
the shop door with his back to me, looking into the street. I was
about five minutes preparing them. He stood at the door till they
were ready, when I delivered them to him&mdash;the prussic acid in the
bottle he had brought, the strychnia in a paper, and the opium in
a bottle. He paid, and took them away. No one else was in the
shop.”</p>

<p class="p1">As soon as Palmer had left, Newton came in, and spoke to
Roberts about Palmer’s visit, and no doubt was struck with
the information he received. At that time he did not mention
to his master Palmer’s purchase of the strychnia because, he
said, Palmer and Salt were not friends, and he was afraid that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the latter might blame him for having given Palmer the
strychnia. “I first mentioned it,” said <i>Newton</i>, “to Boycott,
the clerk to Mr. Gardner, the solicitor, at the Rugeley station,
when I and a number of witnesses were assembled for the
purpose of going to London. He took me to Mr. Gardner’s.
I told him what I had to say, and he took me to the solicitor
of the Treasury.” Counsel for the defence tried to elicit from
him that he had given as his reason for not mentioning it
before that he was afraid of being prosecuted for perjury.
“No,” he replied; “I did not give that as a reason, but I
stated to a gentleman that a young man at Wolverhampton
had been threatened by George Palmer because he had said
at the inquest on Walter Palmer that he had sold the prisoner
prussic acid, and he had not entered it in the book, and could
not prove it. I stated at the same time that George Palmer
said he could be transported for it. The inquest on Walter
Palmer did not take place until five or six weeks after that on
Cook.”</p>

<p>Not only, however, did Newton<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> not mention this purchase
of strychnia when before the coroner, but he did not state that
on the 25th of November he was sent for about seven in the
evening to Palmer’s house, where he found the prisoner in his
kitchen, sitting by the fire reading.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He asked me,” he now said, “how I was, and to have some
brandy and water. No one else was there. He asked me what
was the dose of strychnia to kill a dog. I told him a grain. He
asked me what would be the appearance after death. I told him
that there would be no inflammation, and that I did not think it
could be found. Upon that he snapped his finger and thumb in a
quiet way and exclaimed, as if communing with himself, ‘That’s
all right.’ He made some other commonplace remark, which I do
not recollect. I was with him altogether about five minutes.”</p>

<p class="p1">Though he appears to have related the story of the dog at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
an earlier date, it was not until the Tuesday before the trial
that he said a word to anyone about the purchase of the
strychnia.</p>

<p>To contradict the evidence of Newton, the inspector of
police at the Euston station was called to prove that the last
train for Rugeley left at 2<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and that if Palmer went by
the five o’clock express he would not get to Stafford until
8.45, and would then have nine miles to travel to reach
Rugeley. It was, however, remarked by the Attorney-General
that Newton’s words were “about nine o’clock,” and “that
everyone knows how easy it is to make a mistake of half an
hour or three quarters of an hour, or even an hour, if your
attention is not called to the circumstances within a week or a
fortnight, or three weeks afterwards.” Not content with this
evidence, counsel for the defence called one Jeremiah Smith,
an attorney, of Rugeley, and intimate friend of the prisoner’s
mother, who swore that on the night in question he saw
Palmer get out of a car coming in the direction from Stafford
at ten minutes past ten, and went with him to Cook’s room.
The exhibition made by this fellow in the box was disgusting.
For some time he declared that he had never had anything to
do with the applications for the enormous insurances on
Walter Palmer’s life; would not acknowledge his signature to
them as a witness, and only after a most vigorous <i>cross-examination</i>
admitted that he witnessed them on the application of the
prisoner. He it was who made the application to the Midland
Insurance Company for the policy of £10,000 on the life of
Bate, the person whom Palmer represented as a gentleman
of property with a fine cellar of wine, but whom the insurance
agent found hoeing turnips in a field of Palmer’s, and with
six months’ rent in arrear for the room in the farm-house
which he occupied. The credit of Newton was set up by the
desperate attempt of Mr. Jeremiah Smith.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p class="psh">ACTS OF THE PRISONER DURING COOK’S ILLNESS AND
AFTER HIS DEATH.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 15th of November, Cook returned from
Shrewsbury with Palmer to the “Talbot,” at Rugeley, complaining
of being poorly. It will be remembered that he had
been sick at Shrewsbury after partaking of the brandy and
water in Palmer’s company. Next day he dined with Palmer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and came back to the inn between nine and ten at night, as
the witness Barnes said, sober. Early the next morning
(Saturday) Palmer was in his bedroom, and sent for a cup of
coffee for him. Mills, who brought it up, did not see him
drink it; but when soon after she went into his room she
found he had vomited it in the chamber. Palmer was in and
out frequently, and promised to send Cook some soup; for
this he sent <i>Ann Rowley</i>, a charwoman to the “Albion Inn,”
who brought it to Palmer in his kitchen, left it there about
five minutes with him, whilst she went about her other work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and then, by Palmer’s orders, took it to the “Talbot,” with a
message that Jerry Smith, a mutual friend who had dined
with them on the Friday, had sent it.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Cook, seeming unwilling
to take this, Palmer said he must have it. It was
taken up again; Cook drank it, and shortly after vomited.
Again, on the Sunday, Palmer sent a jobbing gardener in his
employ with a covered cup of broth to the “Talbot,” of which
Mills, who took it up to Cook’s room, tasted about two tablespoonsful,
and was so sick that she had to go to bed. Whether
Cook drank this or not was not distinctly proved, but the cup
was afterwards seen empty in the kitchen of the hotel. What
followed as to the pills sent by Dr. Bamford, and the others
produced by Palmer, is already fully given in Mills’s evidence.
Immediately after Cook’s death, Palmer was found by Barnes
searching the pockets of Cook’s coat and under his pillow, and
the bank-notes which Cook had had only a few days before,
his betting-book, which had been seen on his dressing-table,
and the letters that had been on his chimney-piece, had disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Previously to this time Palmer had been very
short of money, being pressed for small debts, but immediately
afterwards was in funds, paying small bills, and
depositing £50 in a local bank. On Tuesday evening (20th),
when Cook was in such a serious state, Palmer sent for
Cheshire, the Rugeley postmaster, and asked him to fill up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the body of a cheque on Weatherby for £350 in Palmer’s
favour, which he said that he would take over to Cook to
sign. That cheque was sent to Weatherby’s that night, and
returned by them to Palmer, as Weatherby, not having yet
received the stakes Cook had won, was not in funds to meet
it. That cheque was called for by the prosecution, but not
produced by the prisoner. Again, on the Thursday or Friday
after, between six and seven in the evening, Palmer sent for
Cheshire. “When I arrived,” said the witness, “I found
him in the kitchen, and he immediately went out, and shortly
after returned with a quarto sheet of paper in his hand. He
gave me a pen, and asked me to sign something. I asked
what it was, and he replied, ‘You know that Cook and I have
had dealings together, and this is a document he gave me
some days ago, and I want you to witness it.’ I said, ‘What
is it about?’ He said, ‘Some business that I have joined
in with him, and which is all for his benefit, and this is the
document stating so.’” Cheshire refused, and Palmer, saying
perhaps they would not dispute Cook’s signature, took it
away. This document was also called for, and not produced.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>On Friday, 23rd, <i>Mr. Stevens</i>, who had married the widow
of Cook’s father some years before, and was executor to his
grandfather’s will, arrived in Rugeley, saw Palmer, and asked
him about his stepson’s affairs. “There are £4000 of his
bills out,” said Palmer, “and I am sorry to say my name is
to them, but I have got a paper drawn up and signed by him
to show that I never had any money from them.” Mr. Stevens
expressed great surprise, and said, “I fear there will not be
4000 shillings to pay you.” Then, after discussing his stepson’s
affairs, Mr. Stevens said, “Well, whether he has left
anything or not, poor fellow, he must be buried,” on which
Palmer immediately said, “Oh, I will bury him myself, if that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
is all.” Mr. Stevens at once refused, and expressed his intention
of removing the body to London for interment, so as not
to inconvenience the inn people. “Oh,” said Palmer, “that
is of no consequence, but the body ought to be fastened up;
as long as the body is fastened up, it is of no consequence.”
Whilst Mr. Stevens was talking with the persons in the room,
Palmer went out, and on his return, when asked by Stevens
to recommend an undertaker, said, “I have been and done
this. I have ordered a shell and a strong oak coffin.” Mr.
Stevens expressed his surprise, and insisted on giving instructions
himself to the undertaker.</p>

<p>Later in the day, after dinner, on Mr. Jones reporting to
Stevens, who had asked him to go up to Cook’s room for that
purpose, that he could not find any betting-book or papers,
Palmer said, “Oh, it’s no manner of use if you do find it.”
“No use,” replied Stevens, “I am the best judge of that.”
Again said Palmer, “It’s of no manner of use.” “I am told
it is,” was the reply; “my son won a great deal of money at
Shrewsbury, and I ought to know something about it.” “It
is of no use, I assure you,” replied Palmer; “when a man
dies, his bets are done with; and besides, Cook received the
greater part of the money on the course.” “Very well,”
replied Stevens, “the book ought to be found, and must be
found,” when Palmer said, in a quieter tone, “It will be
found, no doubt.” The room was then locked by Mr. Stevens’s
order, but the book was never found.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens returned to London to see his solicitor, and on
his way back met Palmer (who had been to London to pay
Pratt £100, and caution him against giving any information
about Cook’s affairs), and told him his intention of having a
<i>post-mortem</i> examination. Apparently agreeing with that,
Palmer offered to introduce him to a local solicitor to conduct
it, which was declined; but, added Mr. Stevens, “I said,
‘Mr. Palmer, if I should call in a solicitor to give me advice,
I suppose you will have no objection to answer any question
he may put to you.’ I altered my tone purposely; I looked
him steadily in the face, but although the moon was shining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
I could not see his features distinctly. He said, with a
spasmodic convulsion of the throat, which was perfectly apparent,
‘Oh no, certainly not.’” Later in the evening
Palmer came to Mr. Stevens and renewed his conversation
about the bills, hoping that affairs would be settled pleasantly,
and was told by the stepfather that “they could be only
settled in Chancery.” Palmer, at that time, denied that he
had attended Cook in a medical capacity.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November, <i>Ishmael Fisher</i>, who was Cook’s
usual racing agent, received a letter from Cook requesting him
to pay Pratt £200, which he would repay him on the following
Monday, when the Shrewsbury bets would be settled at
Tattersall’s. Much to his surprise, he was not employed as
usual, and in consequence lost the money he had advanced,
for on the 19th <i>Mr. George Herring</i>, another betting man,
got a letter from Palmer to call on him at the latter’s lodgings,
in London, at half-past two that day. He did so.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I found Palmer there,” said <i>Herring</i>. “He asked me what I
would take. I declined to take anything. I then asked him how
Mr. Cook was. He said, ‘He’s all right; his physician gave him a
dose of calomel, and advised him not to come out, it being a damp
day.’ I don’t know which term he used, ‘damp’ or ‘wet.’ He
then went on to say, in the same sentence, ‘What I want to see
you about is settling his account.’ While he was speaking he took
out half a sheet of note paper from his pocket, and it was open
when he had finished the sentence. He held it up and said, ‘This
is it.’ I rose to take it. He said, ‘You had better take its contents
down; this will be a check against you.’ At the same time
he pointed to some paper lying on the table. I wrote on that
paper from his dictation. I have here the paper which I so wrote.
[The witness read the document in question, which contained instructions
as to certain payments he should make out of moneys to
be received by him at Tattersall’s on account of the Shrewsbury
races.] Palmer then said that I had better write out a cheque for
Pratt and Padwick&mdash;for the former £450, and for the latter £350,
and send them at once. I told him I had only one form of
cheque in my pocket. He said I could easily fill up a draught on
half a sheet of paper. I refused to comply with his request, as I
had not as yet received the money. He replied that it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
all right, for that Cook would not deceive me. He wished me particularly
to pay Mr. Pratt the £450. His words, as nearly as I
can remember them, were, ‘You must pay Pratt, as it is for a bill
of sale on the mare.’ I don’t know whether he said ‘a bill of sale,’
or ‘a joint bill of sale.’ He told me he was going to see both Pratt
and Padwick, to tell them that I would send on the money. Previous
to his saying this, I told him that if he would give me the
address of Pratt and Padwick I would call on them, after I had got
the money from Tattersall’s, and give it to them. He then asked
me what was between us. There were only a few pounds between
us, and after we had had some conversation on the point, he took
out of his pocket a £50 Bank of England note. He required £29
out of the note, and I was not able to give it; but he said that if
I gave him a cheque it would answer as well. I gave him a cheque
for £20 and nine sovereigns. When I was going away I do not
remember that he said anything about my paying the money to
Pratt and Padwick. He said on parting, ‘When you have settled
this account write down word to either me or Cook.’ I turned
round and said, ‘I shall certainly write to Mr. Cook.’ I said so
because I thought I was settling Mr. Cook’s account. He said,
‘It don’t much matter which you write to.’ I said, ‘If I address
Mr. Cook, Rugeley, Stafford, it will be correct, will it not?’ He
said, ‘Yes.’ After leaving Beaufort Buildings I went to Tattersall’s.
I then received all the money I expected, except £110 from Mr.
Morris, who paid me £90 instead of £200. I sent from Tattersall’s
a cheque for £450 to Mr. Pratt. I posted a letter to Cook from
Tattersall’s, and directed it to Rugeley. On Tuesday the 20th,
next day, I received a telegraphic message. I have not got it
here. I gave it to Captain Hatton at the coroner’s inquest at
Rugeley. In consequence of receiving that message I wrote again
to Cook that day. I addressed my letter as before, but I believe
the letter was not posted till the Wednesday. I have three bills
of exchange with me. I know Palmer’s handwriting, but never
saw him write. I cannot prove his writing; but I knew Cook’s
writing, and I believe the drawing of two and the accepting of the
three bills to be in his writing. I got them from Fisher and gave him
cash for them.” [The witness Boycott was recalled, and identified
the signatures on the bills as those of Palmer and Cook.]</p>

<p><i>Examination continued.</i>&mdash;“The bills are each for £200. One of
them was payable in a month, and when it fell due on October 18,
Cook paid the £100 on account. He paid me the remaining £100
at Shrewsbury, but I cannot tell with certainty on what day. I
did not pay the £350 to Padwick. I hold another bill for £500.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>”
[Thomas Strawbridge, manager of the bank at Rugeley, identified
the drawing and endorsing as in the handwriting of Palmer. The
acceptance, purporting to be in the writing of Mrs. Sarah Palmer,
he did not believe to have been written by her.]</p>

<p><i>Examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I am sure that the endorsement on
the £500 bill is in Cook’s writing. I got the bill from Mr. Fisher.
I paid £200 on account of it to Palmer, and £275 to Mr. Fisher.
The balance was discount. It was not paid at maturity. I have
taken proceedings against Palmer to recover the amount.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On the 26th of November, the <i>post-mortem</i> examination
was held, at which Palmer was present, and the incidents of
the pushing of the jar containing the contents of the stomach
and the cutting of its coverings occurred; and if the evidence
of <i>Myatt</i>, the postboy, is to be taken as true, Palmer tried to
bribe him to upset the fly in which Mr. Stevens and his
solicitor’s clerk were to take the jar to the Stafford station,
<i>en route</i> to London,</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>James Myatt, examined by Mr. James.</i>&mdash;“In November last I
was postboy at the ‘Talbot Arms,’ Rugeley. I know Palmer, the
prisoner, and I remember Monday, the 26th of November last. I
was ordered on that night, a little after five o’clock, to take Mr.
Stevens to the Stafford station in a fly. Before I started I went
home to get my tea, and on returning from my tea to the ‘Talbot
Arms’ I met the prisoner. He asked me if I was going to drive
Mr. Stevens to Stafford. I told him I was.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What did he say to you then?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“He asked me if I would upset them.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Them? Had anything been said about a jar?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“He said he supposed I was going to take the jar.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What did you say then?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I said I believed I was.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What did he say after that?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“He said&mdash;‘Do you think you could upset them?’”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What answer did you make?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I told him ‘No.’”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did he say anything more?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“He said&mdash;‘If you could, there’s a £10 note for
you.’”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What did you say to that?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I told him I could not. I then said, ‘I must go, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
horses are in the fly ready for us to start.’ I do not recollect that
he said anything more about the jar. I said, that if I didn’t go
somebody else would go. He told me not to be in a hurry, for if
anybody else went he would pay me. I saw him again next morning,
when I was going to breakfast. He asked me then who went
with the fly. I told him Mr. Stevens, and, I believed, one of Mr.
Gardner’s clerks.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;“Were not the words
that Palmer used&mdash;‘I wouldn’t mind giving £10 to break Stevens’s
neck?’”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I don’t recollect the words ‘break his neck.’”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Well, ‘upset him.’ Did he say, ‘I wouldn’t mind
giving £10 to upset him?’”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; I believe those were the words. I do not know
that Palmer appeared to have been drinking. I don’t recollect
that he had. I can’t say that he used any epithet, applied to
Stevens&mdash;he said it was a humbugging concern altogether, or something
of that. I don’t recollect that he said Stevens was a troublesome
fellow, and very inquisitive. I don’t remember anything
more than I have said. I do not know whether there was more
than one jar.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Whilst the analysis of the contents of the jar was being
conducted in London, the coroner opened an inquest at
Rugeley. Palmer, now fully aware of his danger, determined
to use his influence over the postmaster to get the earliest
information of the results of the analysis, and to make a
friend of Ward, the coroner. With the latter object, he sent
a hamper of fish and game to the coroner from London on
the 1st of December, writing the direction himself, but not
otherwise letting Ward know from whom they came, which he
professed to wish to be kept secret. To Cheshire, the postmaster,
with whom he had long been on very friendly terms,
receiving from him his mother’s and Cook’s letters, on the
2nd of December he hinted the importance of his knowing anything
that might pass through the post between Dr. Taylor and
the local solicitor. In consequence, on the Wednesday following,
he is told by Cheshire the substance of the letter,
already quoted, written by the analyst to Mr. Gardner on the
previous day. On this Palmer, on the 8th, writes to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
poulterer at Stafford to have some game ready for his messenger,
and sends Bate over for it, to take it, with the
following note, to the coroner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir,</span>&mdash;I am sorry to tell you that I am still confined
to my bed. I don’t think it was mentioned at the inquest yesterday
that Cook was taken ill on Sunday and Monday night, in the
same way as he was on the Tuesday, when he died. The chambermaid
at the ‘Crown’ Hotel (Masters’s) can prove this. I also
believe that a man by the name of Fisher is coming down to prove
he received some money at Shrewsbury. Now, here he could only
pay Smith £10 out of £41 he owed him. Had you not better
call Smith to prove this? And, again, whatever Professor Taylor
may say to-morrow, he wrote from London last Tuesday night to
Gardner to say, ‘We (and Dr. Rees) have this day finished our
analysis, and find no traces of either strychnia, prussic acid, or
opium.’ What can beat this from a man like Taylor, if he says
what he has already said, and Dr. Harlands’s evidence? Mind you,
I know and saw it in black and white what Taylor said to Gardner;
but this is strictly private and confidential, but it is true.
As regards his betting-book, I know nothing of it, and it is of no
good to anyone. I hope the verdict to-morrow will be that he
died of natural causes, and thus end it.</p>

<p class="pr2">“Ever yours, “W. P.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Bate goes to the poulterer, re-directs, and sends the game
by a lad, and then finds his way to the inn, where the coroner
is smoking, calls him out of the billiard-room, and privately
gives him the letter.</p>

<p>On the 14th of December the adjourned inquest is to be
held, and Dr. Taylor’s evidence taken. On the previous day,
therefore, Bate is again summoned by Palmer, and sent to
borrow a £5 note of Thirlby, and on his return, Palmer being
still ill in bed, is told by him to look in a drawer for another,
but can only find one for £50. At this juncture the sheriff’s
officer arrives to arrest him on one of the overdue bills, Bate
is sent out of the room, and on his return commissioned to
take a note to the coroner, and to be sure that no one sees him
deliver it. This he succeeds in doing between the “station”
and the “Junction Hotel,” where he slips it slily into Ward’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
hand. Not liking all this secrecy, Bate had hesitated at accepting
the mission, and asked that some one else should be
sent, when Palmer replied, “Why, George, as to this poor
fellow Cook, he was the best pal I ever had in my life; and
why should I have poisoned him?” and then added, “I am
as innocent as you, George.” The inquest proceeded, and in
addition to the evidence of the symptoms attendant on Cook’s
death, Dr. Taylor gave his, and Roberts proved the purchase
of strychnia only a day before Cook’s death. Palmer was
summoned, but professed to be too ill to come, and on the
next day a verdict of wilful murder against him was returned,
and a warrant issued for his transfer to Stafford jail. After a
few days’ detention in his own house, Palmer was conveyed to
jail, in such a state of despondency that he appears to have
determined to starve himself to death, and would probably
have done so, but for the threat of compulsory measures by
the Governor. Soon afterwards all his property was seized
under a bill of sale and sold, his racehorses alone realising
four thousand guineas.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p class="psh">THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Serjeant Shee’s address to the jury in the defence
of the prisoner, which occupied, without wearying, the attention
of the Court during eight hours on the seventh day, only
a brief analysis can be given. The main points on which he
insisted were&mdash;<i>First</i>, the erroneous nature of the medico-scientific
evidence in referring the symptoms exhibited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Cook’s case to <i>tetanus</i> from <i>strychnia</i>, on which he was
prepared to contradict it by witnesses of equal character
and credit in the profession. <i>Secondly</i>, the probability,
amounting as near as possible to a certainty, that if the death
had been occasioned by strychnia, the presence of that poison
should have been detected by the analysts. <i>Thirdly</i>, the similarity
of the symptoms in the case to those of cases of <i>traumatic</i>
or <i>idiopathic tetanus</i> of late occurrence, to be described by the
doctors who had attended them. As the mass of evidence by
which he sought to support these propositions has been
already reported, it is needless to recur to it. We may
therefore pass on to the moral evidence, only pausing to
extract the noble passage descriptive of the mechanism of the
human frame, with which he introduced the former subject,
and his picture of Cook’s state of mind from before his victory
at Shrewsbury until his death.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“‘A little learning is a dangerous thing.’</p>

<p class="p1">“It appears to me there never was a case in which the adage
was so applicable as it is in this. Of all the works of God, the
one best calculated to fill us with wonder and admiration, and
convince us of our dependence on our Maker, and the utter nothingness
of ourselves, is the mortal coil in which we live, and breathe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and think, and have our being. Every minute of our lives,
functions are performed at our will, the unerring accuracy of which
nothing but omniscience and omnipotence could have secured. We
feel and see exactly what takes place, and yet the moment we
attempt to explain what takes place, the instant we endeavour to
get a reason for what we know, and see, and do, the mystery of
creation&mdash;‘God created man in his own image, in the image of
God created he them’&mdash;arrests our course, and we are flung back
on conjecture and doubt. We know in a sense&mdash;we suppose&mdash;that
the soft medullary substance which is within the cavity of
the head is the seat of thought, of sensation, and of will. We
know that that soft medullary substance is continued down the
middle of the back, protected by a bony duct or canal, within
which it lies embedded, and we know that from the sides of that
bony duct and from this medullary substance proceed an infinite
variety of nerves (the conduits of sensation from all parts of the
body to the soul) and of muscles connected and dependent on
them, the instruments of voluntary motion. This we know; and
we know that by that process all the ordinary actions of ourselves,
at our will, are effected with the most wonderful precision. Sometimes,
however, these nerves and muscles depart from their normal
character, and instead of being the mere instruments of the soul,
become irregular, convulsive, tumultuary, vindicating to themselves
a sort of independent vitality, totally regardless of the authority
to which they are ordinarily subject. When thrown into this
state of excitement, their effects are known by the general name
of convulsions. It is remarkable, unlike most other fine names,
they are not of modern adaptation. The ancients had them to
express the very same thing. The spasmodic and tetanic affections
were known then, and as much about them hundreds and thousands
of years ago as is known now. Tetanic convulsions have been
divided in later times into two specific branches of tetanus&mdash;idiopathic
and traumatic.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In opening the portion of his case that Cook’s death was
attributable to causes other than strychnia, Serjeant Shee
adroitly concealed the names of the diseases to which his witnesses
were prepared to attribute it. Until, therefore, his
cloud of witnesses had been passed through, the prosecution
did not know, except from the <i>cross-examination</i> of their own
medico-scientific witnesses, to what technical points they had
to shape their reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>In support of his contention that Cook’s death could be
fairly attributed to ordinary convulsions, the learned Serjeant
gave the following graphic sketch of the state of his mind at
the period of Shrewsbury races, and from then to his death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“He went there in the imminent peril of returning from them
a ruined man. His stepfather assured Palmer that there would
not be 4000 shillings for those who had claims on his estate. From
the necessity he was under of raising money at an enormous discount
we may easily infer that he was in desperate difficulties, and
that unless some sudden success on the turf should retrieve his
fortunes, they were hopeless. His health was shattered, his mind
distracted; he had long been cherishing hopes that Polestar would
win, and so put him in possession of something like a thousand
guineas. The mare, it was true, was hardly his own, for she had
been mortgaged; and if she should lose, she would become the property
of another person. Picture to yourselves what must have
been the condition, mental and bodily, of that young man when he
rose from his bed on the morning of the races. It is scarcely possible,
as he went down to breakfast, that this thought must not
have crossed his mind, ‘My fate is trembling in the balance; this
is the crisis of my destiny. Unless my horse shall win, to-night I
am a beggar.’ With these feelings he repairs to the course.
Another race is run before Polestar is brought out. His impatience
is extreme. He looks on in a state of agonising excitement. Will
the minutes never fly? At last arrives the decisive moment; the
time has come for his race. The flag is dropped; the horses start;
his mare wins easily, and he, her master, has won a thousand
guineas! For three minutes he is not able to speak, so intense is
his emotion. Slowly he recovers his utterance, and then how
rapturous is his joy! He is saved, he is saved! Another chance
to retrieve his position&mdash;one chance more to recover his character!
As yet, at all events, he will not be a disgrace to his family and
his friends. Conceive him to be, with all his faults, an honourable
young man, and you may easily imagine what his ecstasy must
have been. He loves the memory of his dead mother&mdash;he still
reverences the name of his father&mdash;he is jealous of his sister’s
honour, and it may be that he cherishes silently in his heart the
thought of some other being dearer still than all to whom the
story of his ruin would bring bitter anguish. But he is not ruined;
he will meet his engagements like an honourable man. There is
now no danger of his being an outcast, an adventurer, a black-leg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
He will live to redeem his position, and to give joy to those who
love him. With such thoughts in his heart, he returns to his inn
in a state of indescribable elation, and with a revulsion from
despair that must have convulsed&mdash;though not in the sense of
illness&mdash;every fibre of his frame. His first idea is to entertain
his friends, and he does so. The evidence does not prove that he
drank to excess, but he gave a champagne dinner; and we all
know that is a luxurious entertainment, at which there is no stint
and not much self-respect. That evening he did not spend in the
society of Palmer; indeed, it is not clear in whose company he
spent it. But we find him on the evening of Wednesday at the
‘Unicorn’ with Saunders, his trainer, and a lady. On Thursday
he walks upon the course, and Herring remonstrates with him for
doing so, as the day is damp and misty, and the ground wet.
That night he is seized with illness, and he continues ailing until
his death at Rugeley. Arrived at Rugeley, it is but natural to
suppose that a reaction of feeling may have set in. Then the
dark side of the picture may have presented itself to his imagination.
The chilling thought may have come upon him that his
winnings were already forestalled and would scarcely suffice to save
him from destruction. It is when suffering from a weakened body,
and an irritated and excited mind, that he is attacked by a sickness
which clings to his system, leaves him without any rest,
incapacitates him from taking food, distracts his nerves, and places
him in imminent danger of falling a victim to any sudden attack
of convulsions to which he may have a predisposition. He relished
no society so much as that of Palmer, whose residence was immediately
opposite the ‘Talbot Arms’ Inn, where he was lying on his
sick bed. For two days he had been taking opiate pills prescribed
by Dr. Bamford. On Sunday night, at twelve o’clock, he started
as from a dream in a state of the utmost excitement and alarm.
He admitted afterwards that for two minutes he was mad, but he
could not ascribe it to anything unless to his having been
awakened by a squabble in the street. But do no such things
happen to people of sound constitutions and regular habits?
Do no such people awaken in agony and delirium because there is
a noise under their windows? No; these are the afflictions of the
dissipated and anxious, whose bodies are shattered and whose
minds are distracted. Next day, Monday, he was pretty well, but
not so well as to mount his horse or to take a walk in the fields.
He could converse with his trainer and jockey, but he could take
no substantial food, and drank not a drop of brandy-and-water.
You will bear in mind that Palmer was not with him that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
In the middle of the night he was seized with an attack similar in
character to that of the night preceding, but manifestly much
milder, for he retained his consciousness throughout it, and was
not mad for a moment. The evidence of Elizabeth Mills is conclusive
on the point. At three o’clock on the following day
(Tuesday) Mr. Jones, the surgeon of Lutterworth, arrived, and
spent a considerable time&mdash;probably from three to seven o’clock&mdash;in
his company. They had abundant opportunity for conversing
confidentially, and they were likely to have done so, for they were
very intimate, and Jones appears to have been on more familiar
terms with Cook than was any other person, not even excepting
Mr. Stevens. Nothing occurred in the entire and unbounded
confidence which must have existed between Mr. Cook and Mr.
Jones, to raise any suspicions in the mind of Mr. Jones; and at
the consultation, which took place between seven and eight o’clock
on Tuesday evening between Jones, Palmer, and Bamford, as to
what the medicine for that evening should be, the fit of the
Monday night was not mentioned. That is a remarkable fact.
The Crown may say that it is remarkable, inasmuch as Palmer
knew it, and said not a word about it; but I think that it shows
that the fit was so little serious in the opinion of Cook that he did
not think it worth mentioning to his intimate friend.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In dealing with the “moral evidence,” counsel <i>first</i> attacked
the motive imputed by the prosecution, and sought to show
from the correspondence, as well as from the conduct of the
parties, that at the moment when Palmer was charged with
killing Cook, he was his best and indeed the only friend
whom he could look to to assist him in his severe financial
troubles.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Was it,” he said, “to his interest that in the second week
in November Cook should be killed, say by a railway accident?
For some time they had been mixed up together in racing
transactions, had made heavy losses during the late sporting
season, and Cook at least&mdash;and most probably Palmer, as associated
with him&mdash;was looking forward to the success of Polestar
to save them from ruin. At that time Pratt, the bill discounter,
was pressing for an extra £200 to stave off legal proceedings on
the £2000 bill, to which his mother’s name had been forged. To
whom does Palmer apply? To Cook, who at once writes to his
betting agent Fisher to advance and pay that to Pratt on the
Saturday before the Monday’s settlement at Tattersall’s of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Shrewsbury winnings. Fisher having done this, was it not probable
that Cook arranged with Palmer, that in order to get the
use of this £200 for a few days, Herring, and not Fisher, should
be authorised to collect the winnings and secure a sufficient payment
to Pratt to stave off the action?” [Cook’s letter of the
19th of November was accordingly cited as a proof of his anxiety
to assist Palmer.] “Again, there was in Herring’s hands a bill of
Palmer’s for £500, bearing his mother’s forged acceptance. Was
it likely that with this danger staring him in the face, Palmer
would kill the only man from whom he could look for money?
The transaction as to the bill for £500, secured on Cook’s racehorses,
discounted by Pratt, for which, as Pratt wrote him at once,
Palmer would have to provide, was another reason for not killing
his only friend.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In September Palmer had negotiated this bill with Pratt
professedly for Cook’s benefit, and had received from Pratt a
crossed cheque to Cook’s order for £385, and a wine warrant
for £65, and at the same time, on his own account, £315 in
cash, and the imputation by the Crown was that he forged
Cook’s endorsement and took the money. The improbability
of his doing this, as Cook was certain, had he done so, to
have complained of it during the months that elapsed between
the giving of the bill of sale on his horses and his death, was
urged by Mr. Shee, who ventured to offer as an explanation
the suggestion that as Cook wanted cash on that day, Palmer
gave him his £315, and with his consent endorsed Cook’s
name on the cheque and paid that to his own account. Again
he dealt with the circumstance of Cook’s cheque for £350,
the body of which was drawn by Cheshire, and, as Palmer
said, taken by him on the 20th November to Cook for him to
sign in his sick room. That cheque, it will be remembered,
was not produced, but</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Weatherby, on whom it was drawn,” said Serjeant Shee, “was
under the impression that the signature was Cook’s.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> As it was
not certain that Frail would have sent up to Weatherby the stakes
against which it was drawn by the Monday, was it likely that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
had Palmer meditated Cook’s death at the time, he would have
risked its being returned&mdash;as it was&mdash;and passing into the hands
of Cook’s executors, who would be certain to enquire into the
matter, on Cook’s sudden death? From the enquiries that had
been instituted as to his brother’s life policy, he knew himself to
be an object of suspicion, and, if any foul play happened to Cook,
all hope of recovering that would be gone. ‘Their refusal,’ wrote
Pratt to him, ‘altered the whole state of affairs, and Palmer must
be prepared to pay his mother’s acceptances for £4,000 due at the
end of the month.’ There was the pinch; the office would not
pay; the £4,000 was becoming due; the holder of the bills saw
that he was without security, and, if anything occurred to increase
the suspicions of the insurance office, which was very reluctant to
pay, the £13,000 was lost for ever, lost beyond hope. Gentlemen,
that £13,000 is sure to be paid, unless this man is convicted of
murder; and that has a great deal to do with the clamour and
alarm which have been excited. So sure as that man is saved, and
saved I believe he will be, that £13,000 is paid. There is no
defence, no pretence for a defence&mdash;the letters of the office make
that plain. They took an enormous premium; knowing that the
man was only 30, they took a premium for a man of 50&mdash;at least,
the letters show that the premium was enormous&mdash;and I say that,
as sure as this man is saved, that £13,000 is good for him, and
will pay his creditors. Do not these facts show that in this
October suspicions were hanging in menacing meteors about
Palmer’s head, which would come down with irresistible momentum
and crush him upon suspicion of a sudden death by
murder? Do you believe that a man who wrote what the effects
of strychnia were in his manual would risk such a scene as a
death-bed by it, in the presence of the dearest and best friend of
Cook&mdash;a man whom he could not influence; a medical man, who
liked him and loved him well enough when he knew he was ill to
sleep in the same room with him, that he might be able to attend
to him in case he wanted assistance during the night? Is that
common sense? Are you going to endorse such a theory as that
upon the suggestion of Dr. Taylor about the effects of strychnia
produced upon his five rabbits? Impossible! perfectly impossible!
as I submit to you. So sure as anything happened by foul
play to Cook, he had no more chance of getting the £13,000 than
the £180,000 from the Prince of Wales Insurance Office&mdash;none
whatever. That was the only means he had at that time of extricating
himself from these encumbrances.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Again, he tried to depreciate the evidence of Mills as to
the symptoms of Cook’s attacks, on the ground&mdash;not, indeed,
that she had been tampered with by the prosecution&mdash;because
then, he said, he was certain that she would not have been
called&mdash;but “that she had been instructed in the various
symptoms by the repeated private examinations to which she
had been subjected,” dwelling on the omission from her evidence
before the coroner that she had been so violently sick
after tasting the broth, and on the other discrepancies in, and
omissions from, her description of the symptoms when there,
and when in court.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Upon all occasions,” said the learned counsel, “I am most reluctant
to attack a witness who is examined on his or her oath,
and particularly if he be in a humble position of life. I am very
reluctant to impute perjury to such a person; and I think that a
man who has been as long in the profession as I have been must
be put a little to his wits’ end when he rushes upon the assumption
that a person whose statements have, after a considerable lapse of
time, materially varied, is, therefore, necessarily, deliberately perjured.
The truth is, we know perfectly well, that if a considerable
interval of time occurs between the first story and the second, and
if the intelligent and respectable persons who are anxious to investigate
the truth, but who have still a strong moral conviction&mdash;upon
imperfect information&mdash;of the guilt of the accused person,
will talk to witnesses and say, ‘Was there anything of this
kind?’ or, ‘Anything of that kind?’ the witnesses at last catch
hold of the phrase or term which has so often been used to
them, and having in that way adopted it, they fancy they may tell
it in court.”</p>

<p class="p1">He also attacked the conduct of Mr. Stevens, the stepfather,
for, as he said, “goading and irritating Palmer into incautious
expressions, by insinuating that he had stolen a
trumpery betting-book that could not be of use to anyone;”
and attributed Palmer’s anxiety to nominate a local solicitor
to manage affairs to the nature of the pecuniary transactions,
so much relying on honour, making them far more easy of
adjustment by a friendly than by a hostile agent. As for
Myatt, the postboy’s, story of the bribe for upsetting the fly, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
attributed that to a personal feeling against the “meddlesome
old gentleman,” as he called Stevens, and not to any idea of
destroying the probable proofs of his delinquency. His
marked attention to Cook during his illness he attributed to
the interest he necessarily felt in his life, and the sending of
broth and other things from his own house to the wish to
save expense at a time when neither of them were too well
off. “Would he,” said Serjeant Shee, “dream of sending
poisoned broth to an inn, where it was sure to be tasted by
the cook?”</p>

<p>In addition to the scientific witnesses which he would call
to rebut those of the prosecution’s, he would prove that Cook,
previously to the Shrewsbury meeting, was suffering severely
from a syphilitic state of throat, and applying to Palmer for
remedies for it&mdash;that Palmer could not have been in Rugeley
at the time at which Newton swore that he sold the strychnia
to him, and that the incident at the “Raven,” at Shrewsbury,
of the brandy-and-water was a fiction. To what this evidence
of previous illness amounted, and how the two witnesses who
were to negative Newton and disprove the scene at the
“Raven” fared when put in the box, will be seen in the
report of their examination.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Great stress was of course laid
on Palmer’s not only calling in Dr. Bamford, but sending
for Mr. Jones, Cook’s firmest friend, to witness what
proved his last day of life, and on the improbability of Palmer
tampering with the medicines under such professional
supervision.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Is it conceivable that if Palmer meant to slay Cook with
poison in the dead of night, he would previously have insured the
presence in his victim’s chamber of a medical witness, who would
know from his frightful symptoms that the man was not dying a
natural death? He brings a medical man into his room, and
makes him lie within a few inches of the sick man’s bed, that he
may be startled with his terriffic shrieks, and gaze on those
agonizing convulsions which indicate the fatal potency of the
poison. Can you believe it? He might have dispatched him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
by means that defy detection, for Cook was taking morphia
medicinally, and a grain or two more would have silently thrown
him into an eternal sleep;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> but instead of this he sends to
Lutterworth for Jones. You have been told that this was done to
cover appearances. Done to cover appearances! No, no, no!
You cannot believe it. It is not in human nature. It cannot be
true. <i>You cannot find him guilty. You dare not find him guilty on
the supposition of its truth. The country will not stand by you if
you believe it to be true. You will be impeached before the whole world
if you say that it is true. I believe in my conscience it is false, because,
consistently with the laws that govern human nature, it cannot be
true.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">“The incident of his being found searching the clothes
and under the pillow,” said counsel, “ought not to be looked
upon as suspicious, as Mills, who came into the room at the
time, thought no suspicion of it, and there was nothing but
the evidence of a kind and considerate character in his having
ordered the shell and the coffin; nor was it possible to torture
into a presumption of guilt the few words of irritation which
may have fallen from him in the course of a conversation in
which Mr. Stevens treated him with scorn, not to say with
insolence.” And then, alluding to the entry as to the effects
of strychnia in one of his medical books, the learned Serjeant
turned it most adroitly to his own purpose, as the basis of a
peroration so telling in its language and perfect in its construction
that it must be preserved intact.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The Crown had, no doubt, originally intended to rely upon
the prisoner’s medical books as affording damning proof of his
guilt; but I will refer to those volumes for evidences that will
speak eloquently in his favour. In youth and early manhood there
is no such protection for a man as the society of an innocent and
virtuous woman to whom he is sincerely attached. If you find a
young man devoted to such a woman, loving her dearly, and
marrying her for the love he bears her, you may depend upon it
that he is a man of humane and gentle nature, little prone to deeds
of violence. To such a woman was Palmer attached in his youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and I will bring you proof positive to show that the volumes cited
against him were the books he used when a student, and that the
manuscript passages are in the handwriting of his wife. His was
a marriage of the heart. He loved that young and virtuous woman
with a pure and generous affection; he loved her as he now loves
her first-born, who awaits with trembling anxiety the verdict that
will restore him to the arms of his father, or drive that father to
an ignominious death upon the scaffold.” [The prisoner here
covered his face with his hands and shed tears.] “Here in this
book I have conclusive evidence of the kind of man that Palmer
was seven years ago. I find in its pages the copy of a letter
addressed by him while still a student to the woman whom he
afterwards made his wife. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1">“‘<span class="smcap">My dearest Annie</span>,&mdash;I snatch a moment from my studies to your dear,
dear little self. I need scarcely say that the principal inducement I have to
work is the desire of getting my studies finished, so as to be able to press
your dear little form in my arms. With best, best love, believe me, dearest
Annie,</p>

<p class="pr2">‘Your own <span class="smcap">William</span>.’</p>


<p class="p1">“Now this is not the sort of letter that is generally read in
courts of justice. It was no part of my instructions to read that
letter, but the book was put in to prove that this man is a wicked,
heartless, savage desperado; and I show you what he was seven
years ago&mdash;that he was a man who loved a young woman for her
own sake&mdash;loved her with a pure and virtuous affection&mdash;such an
affection as would, in almost all natures, be a certain antidote
against guilt. Such is the man whom it has been my duty to
defend upon this occasion, and upon the evidence that is before
you I cannot believe him to be guilty. Don’t suppose, gentlemen,
that he is unsupported in this dreadful trial by his family and his
friends. An aged mother, who may have disapproved of some part
of his conduct, awaits with trembling anxiety your verdict; a dear
sister can scarcely support herself under the suspense which now
presses upon her; a brave and gallant brother stands by him to
defend him, and spares neither time nor trouble to save him from
an awful doom. I call upon you, gentlemen, to raise your minds
to a capacity to estimate the high duty which you have to perform.
You have to stem the torrent of prejudice; you have to vindicate
the honour and character of your country; you have, with firmness
and courage, to do your duty, and to find a verdict for the Crown
if you believe that guilt is proved; but, if you have a doubt upon
that point, depend upon it that the time will come when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
innocence of that man will be made apparent, and when you will
deeply regret any want of due and calm consideration of the case
which it has been my duty to lay before you.”</p></div>

<p class="psh">THE REPLY.</p>

<p>The greater part of the tenth day was occupied with the
reply of the Attorney-General, dealing in the <i>first</i> part with
the medico-scientific evidence brought forward for the defence,
and contrasting it with that on the part of the prosecution,
and in the <i>latter</i> part pressing home with all his force of
criticism and power of language the suspicious acts of the
prisoner before and after the death of Cook. Between <i>idiopathic</i>
and <i>traumatic tetanus</i> he drew the distinction, “supported,”
as he said, “by the evidence of men who had seen,
not here and there a stray case, but numerous instances of
that disease, that the former was a disease of days, and even
weeks, and not of hours or minutes.” He pointed out that
such were really the symptoms in the cases adduced for the
defence, and ridiculed the notion that the old ulcers of the
spring of the year, with which Dr. Savage had dealt successfully,
could be assigned as the causes of this form of disease
in Cook’s case, and then criticised <i>seriatim</i> the other forms of
convulsive disease to which the witnesses for the defence
attributed it. After referring to the statements of Dr. Savage
and Mr. Stevens as to the state of Cook’s health prior to his
departure for Shrewsbury races, he thus dealt with the
evidences of his state of health offered by the prisoner’s
witnesses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“It is said that at some former time he had exhibited his throat
to some of the witnesses that were called, and had applied to
Palmer for mercurial wash to apply to it, or to some of the ulcers.
The precise period is not fixed, but it is perfectly clear that, though
at one time he had adopted that course, under the recommendation
of Dr. Savage he had got rid of it, and there is not the slightest
pretence for saying that this man was suffering under a syphilitic
affection of any kind; that fact was negatived distinctly and
unequivocally by a man of the highest authority, a medical gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of eminence, under whose treatment the man got so rapidly
well. It is a pretence, gentlemen, which has not the shadow of a
foundation, and which I should be shrinking from my duty if I did
not denounce as altogether unworthy of your consideration. There
was nothing about the man, according to the statement of those
who were competent to give you an opinion, which would warrant,
for a single moment, the supposition that there was anything in
any part of his body which could justify the notion of <i>traumatic
tetanus</i>. Even if there were, the character which his symptoms
assumed when the <i>tetanus</i> set in, is utterly incompatible, according
to the evidence of all the witnesses, with a case of <i>traumatic
tetanus</i>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Then, after pointing out how the two cases of this disease
put forward by the defence were cases of days and hours, and,
not like Cook’s, of minutes, he proceeded to deal with the
suggestion of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<i>Idiopathic tetanus?</i> Proceeding from what? They say that
Mr. Cook was a man of a delicate constitution, subject to excitement;
that he had something the matter with his chest; that, in
addition, he had this diseased condition of his throat, and, putting
all these things together, they say, that if he took cold, he might get
‘<i>idiopathic tetanus</i>.’ We are launched into a sea of speculation
and impossibilities. Mr. Nunneley, who came forward for the
purpose of inducing you to believe this, goes through a bead-roll
of the supposed infirmities of Mr. Cook; talks about his exciteability,
about his delicacy of chest, about the affection of his throat,
goes through these various heads, and says that these things may
have predisposed him to ‘<i>idiopathic tetanus</i>,’ if he took cold.
What evidence is there that he ever did take cold? Not the
slightest in the world. From beginning to end he was never treated
for cold by anybody, and never complained of it to anyone. <i>I cannot
help saying that to me it seems a scandal upon a learned, distinguished,
and liberal profession, that men should put forward such
speculations as these, perverting facts, and drawing from them sophistical
and unwarrantable conclusions with the view of deceiving a jury.
I have the greatest respect for science, no man can have more; but I
cannot repress my indignation and abhorrence when I see it thus
perverted and prostituted to the purposes of a particular cause in a
court of justice.</i> Do not talk to me about excitement, as Mr.
Nunneley did the other day, being the cause of <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>.
You remember the sort of excitement he spoke of, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
unworthy of your notice, and they were topics discreditable to be
put forward by a witness as worthy of the attention of sensible
men constituting such a tribunal as you are.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Again, on Mr. Nunneley’s suggestion that it might be a
case of general convulsions accompanied by tetanic symptoms,
said the Attorney-General.&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Well, but pause a moment, Mr. Nunneley; have you ever seen
one single case in which death arising from general convulsions,
accompanied by tetanic symptoms, has not ended in the unconsciousness
of the patient before death? ‘No, I never knew such a
case&mdash;not one. But in some book or other I am told that there is
such a case reported;’ and he cites one, not for that purpose, I
think, but with reference, to general convulsions being sometimes
accompanied by tetanic symptoms and ending in death, from a very
eminent author of the present day, Dr. Copland. Dr. Copland is
living and Dr. Copland might have been called&mdash;was not called,
notwithstanding the challenge which I threw out. Why? Because
it is infinitely better in such a case to call together from the east
and west practitioners of more or less obscurity, instead of bringing
to bear upon the subject the light of science which is treasured
in the breasts of the eminent practitioners with which this city
abounds.”</p>

<p class="p1">Again, on Mr. Partridge’s evidence of the probable effect of
the granules on the spinal marrow,</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I called his attention,” he said, “to what had evidently not
been done before, namely, the symptoms of Mr. Cook’s case, and
asked him in simple, straightforward terms whether, looking at
these, he would pledge his opinion, in the face of the medical
world and the Court, that this was a case of arachnitis, and he
candidly admitted that he would not assert it.”</p>

<p class="p1">Against Dr. Macdonald’s epileptic convulsions with tetanic
complications, he cited the following from that gentleman’s
cross-examination:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Did you ever know a case of epilepsy, with or without tetanic
complications, in which consciousness was not destroyed before the
patient died? He said ‘No, I cannot say I ever did, but I have
read in some book that such a case occurred.’ Is there anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to make you think this was epilepsy? ‘Well, it may have been
epilepsy, because I do not know what else to ascribe it to, but I
must admit that epilepsy is characterised generally by unconsciousness.’
Well, then, what difference would tetanic complications make?
That he is unable to explain.”</p>

<p class="p1">With the final suggestion of <i>Angina pectoris</i>, he could not
deal so minutely as with the four preceding ones.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The gentleman,” he said, “who was called at the last moment
would not have escaped quite so easily if I had had the books to
which he referred under my hand, and been able to expose, as I
would have done, the ignorance or presumption of the assertion he
dared to make. <i>I say ignorance or presumption; or, what is worse,
an intention to deceive. I assert it in the face of the whole medical
profession, and I am satisfied I shall have a verdict in my favour.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">He then concluded this part of his speech by calling
attention to the fact, that three of the witnesses for the
prisoner, Mr. Partridge, Dr. Robinson, and even Dr. Letheby,
strongly as he was biased for the defence, agreed with Sir B.
Brodie and the other medical witnesses for the Crown, that,
“in the whole of their experience, learning, and information,
they knew of no known disease to which the symptoms of
Mr. Cook could possibly be referred&mdash;a fact the importance
of which it was impossible to exaggerate.”</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that all were agreed, that from the time
that the final paroxysm set in, the symptoms were similar to
those of <i>strychnia tetanus</i>, he dealt with the point which the
defence had raised&mdash;which he admitted deserved their most
attentive consideration&mdash;that there were points of difference,
which had led some of the witnesses to the conclusion that
they could not have resulted from that cause.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Let us see,” he said, “what they are. In the first place, they
showed that the period which elapsed between the supposed administration
of the poison, and the first symptoms, was longer than
they have ever observed in animals upon which they have experimented.
The first observation which arises is this: that there is
a known difference between animal and human life, in the power
with which certain specific things act upon their organization. It
may well be that poison administered to a rabbit will produce its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
effect in a given time. It by no means follows that it will produce
the same effect in the same time on an animal of a different
description. Still less does it follow that it will exercise its baneful
influence in the same time on a human subject. The whole of
the evidence on both sides leads to establish this fact, that not
only in individuals of different species, but in individuals of the
same species, the same poison and the same influence will produce
effects different in degree, different in duration, different in power.
But again, it is perfectly notorious that the rapidity with which the
poison begins to work depends mainly upon the mode of its administration.
If it is administered in a fluid state it acts with
great rapidity. If it is given in a solid state its effects come on
more slowly. If it is given in an indurated substance it will act
with still greater tardiness. Then what was the period at which
this poison began to act after its administration, assuming it to
have been poison? It seems, from Mr. Jones’s statement, that
Palmer came to administer the pills somewhere about 11 o’clock,
but they were not administered on his first arrival, for the patient,
as if with an intuitive sense of the death that awaited him, strongly
resisted the attempts to make him take them; and no doubt these
remonstrances, and the endeavours to overcome them, occupied
some period of time. The pills were at last given. Assuming&mdash;which
I only do for the sake of argument&mdash;that the pills contained
strychnia, how soon did they begin to operate? Mr. Jones says
he went down to his supper, and came back again about 12 o’clock.
Upon his return to the room, after a word or two of conversation
with Cook, he proceeded to undress and go to bed, and had not
been in bed ten minutes before a warning came that another of
the paroxysms was about to take place. The maidservant puts it
still earlier, and it appears that as early as ten minutes before twelve
the first alarm was given, which would make the interval little
more than three-quarters of an hour. When these witnesses tell
us that it would take an hour and a half, or two hours, we see
here another of those exaggerated determinations to see the facts
only in the way that will be most favourable to the prisoner. I
find in some of the experiments that have been made that the
duration of time, before the poison begins to work, has been little,
if anything, less than an hour. In the case of a girl at Glasgow it
was stated that it was three-quarters of an hour before the pills
began to work. There may have been some reason for the pills
not taking effect within a certain period after their administration.
It would be easy to mix them up with substances difficult of solution,
or which might retard their action. I cannot bring myself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
believe that if in all other respects you are perfectly satisfied
that the symptoms, the consequences, the effects, were analogous,
and similar in all respects to those produced by strychnia, you will
conclude that in this case strychnia was not administered, and
found your conclusion on the simple fact that a quarter of an hour
more than usual may have elapsed before the pills operated. But
they say the premonitory symptoms were wanting. They assert
that in the case of animals the animal at first manifests some uneasiness,
shrinks, and draws itself into itself, as it were, and avoids
moving; that certain involuntary twitchings about the head come
on, and that there were no such premonitory symptoms in Cook’s
case. I utterly deny the proposition. I say there were premonitory
symptoms of the most marked character. He is lying in his
bed; he suddenly starts up in an agony of alarm. What made
him do that? Was there nothing premonitory there&mdash;nothing that
warned him the paroxysm was coming on? He jumps up, says,
‘Go and fetch Palmer&mdash;fetch me help! I am going to be ill as I
was last night!’ What was that but a knowledge that the
symptoms of the previous night were returning, and a warning of
what he might expect unless some relief were obtained? He sits
up and prays to have his neck rubbed. What was the feeling about
his neck but a premonitory symptom, which was to precede the
paroxysms that were to supervene? He begs to have his neck
rubbed, and that gives him some comfort. But here they say this
could not have been tetanus from strychnia, because animals cannot
bear to be touched, for a touch brings on a paroxysm&mdash;not only a
touch, but a breath of air, a sound, a word, a movement of any one
near will bring on a return of the paroxysm. Now, in three cases
of death from strychnia we have shown that the patient has
endured rubbing of the limbs, and received satisfaction from that
rubbing. In Mrs. Smyth’s case, when her legs were distorted, she
prayed and entreated that she might have them straightened.
The lady at Leeds, in the case which Dr. Nunneley himself
attended, implored her husband between the spasms to rub her
legs and arms in order to overcome the rigidity. That case was
within his own knowledge, and yet in spite of it, although he
detected strychnia in the body of the unhappy woman, he dares
to say that Cook’s having tolerated the rubbing between the
paroxysms is a proof that he had not taken strychnia. Then
there is the case of Clutterbuck. He had taken an overdose of
strychnia, and suffered from the reappearance of tetanus, and his
only comfort was to have his legs rubbed. Therefore, I say that
the continued endeavour to persuade a jury that the fact of Cook’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
having had his neck rubbed proves that this is not tetanus by
strychnia, shows nothing but the dishonesty and insincerity of the
witnesses who have so dared to pervert the facts. But they go
further, and contend that Cook was able to swallow. So he
was before the paroxysms came on. But nobody has ever
pretended that he could swallow afterwards. He swallowed the
pills, and what is very curious, and illustrates part of the theory,
is this, that it was the act of swallowing the pills, a sort of movement
in raising his head, which brought on the paroxysm of which
he died.”</p>

<p class="p1">Having thus called attention to the fact, that against the
three cases of undoubted poisoning by strychnia (those
of Mrs. Smyth, Mrs. Dove, and Mr. Clutterbuck), the
sufferers in which begged to be rubbed, all that could be set
up was, that animals when thus poisoned could not bear to
be touched, the Attorney-General dealt with the fact of
the rigidity of Cook’s body after death, on which Mr.
Nunneley relied as a proof that it could not be a case of
strychnia poisoning. He cited the evidence of Mr. Herapath,
the very next analyst called by the defence, that in two of his
experiments on animals “the bodies had been indurated and
contorted,” as well that of Dr. Taylor that one of the animals
in his experiments was so rigid after death that it could be
held out in an horizontal position in the air as though it were
on its four legs on a plane surface. “What,” he said, “are
you to think of the honesty of this sort of evidence? “Again,
on the question of the fulness or emptiness of the heart, he
thus accounted for the variation of the symptoms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is obvious to any one who reflects for a single moment that
the question whether the heart shall be found compressed, or the
lungs congested must depend upon the immediate cause of death,
and we know that in cases of tetanus death may result from more
than one cause. All the muscles of the body are subject to the
exciting action of this powerful poison, but no one can tell in what
order those muscles will be affected, or where the poisonous influence
will put forth the fulness of its power. If it acts on the
respiratory muscles, and arrests the play of the lungs, and with it
the breathing of the atmospheric air, the result will be that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
heart will be left full. But if some spasm seizes on the heart,
contracting it and expelling from it the blood that it contains, and
so produces death, the result will be that the heart will be found
empty. So that you never have perfect certainty as to how these
symptoms will manifest themselves after death; but that is again
put forward as if the fact of the heart being empty is a conclusive fact
of the death not having taken place from strychnia. Yet those men
who come here as witnesses under the sanction of scientific authority,
must have heard both these cases spoken to by medical
gentlemen who had examined those two unfortunate patients after
death, and who told us that in both cases they found the heart
empty. That gets rid of that matter. As death takes place from
one or other of these causes, so will be the appearance of the heart,
the brain, and the body after death. There is nothing in this for
a single moment to negative the conclusion which you would
otherwise arrive at from the other symptoms.”</p>

<p class="p1">For the difficulty which he admitted arose from the non-discovery
of strychnia by the analyst, he assigned another
reason besides that of the condition of the stomach and other
parts from the negligence imputed to those who had conducted
the <i>post mortem</i> examination&mdash;namely, the probable smallness
of the fatal dose. In all the cases of experiments on animals
in which the poison had been detected, the doses had been
one or even two grains, yet half a grain would prove fatal;
and where so little as that had been given in experiments,
Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees had failed to detect it. On the
partisanship of Mr. Herapath, sitting by the side of the
prisoner’s counsel, prompting questions, and on his assertion
that he believed that Cook had been killed by strychnia and
that Taylor could and ought to have detected it, his remarks
were those rather of a French Public Prosecutor than an
Attorney-General.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I do not say that alters the fact; but I do say that it induces
one to look at the credit of those witnesses with a very great
amount of suspicion. I reverence a man who, from a sense of
justice and a love of truth&mdash;from those high considerations which
form the noblest character of man&mdash;comes forward in favour of a
man against whom the world may turn in a torrent of prejudice
and aversion, and who stands and states what he believes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the truth. But I abhor the traffic in testimony to which, I regret to
say, men of science sometimes permit themselves to condescend.”</p>

<p class="p1">Whether Newton was believed or not&mdash;and he showed how
his statement was confirmed by Roberts’s account of Palmer’s
conduct at the time of the second purchase of poison, he
urged that of the latter fact there could be no doubt, and
asked what was done with that strychnia. That Palmer
obtained this strychnia was not controverted, and what he did
with it was not attempted to be satisfactorily accounted for.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Purchased for whom? for what? If for a patient why is he
not produced? If for any other purpose, let us at least have it
explained. Has there been a shadow of an explanation? Alas, I
grieve to say, none at all. Something was said, in the outset of
the case, about dogs that had been troublesome in the paddocks,
but that was in September. If there was any recurrence of this,
why are not the grooms here to prove this? Some one must have
assisted Palmer to destroy these dogs. Where are those persons?
Why are they not called? Not only are they not called, they are
not even named. My learned friend does not venture to breathe
even a suggestion.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p class="p1">As for the witness called to disprove the incident of the brandy
and water at Shrewsbury, his solitary evidence, that of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
prisoner’s associates, he urged, would not stand for a moment
against those of the witnesses who had spoken for the prosecution.
As for the attempt to prove that Palmer could not
have been in Rugeley at the time when Newton swore that he
purchased the strychnia, Mr. Jeremiah Smith’s antecedents,
the disgraceful part he had played in the insurance transactions,
let alone his exhibition in the witness-box, he added,
deprived his evidence of credit.</p>

<p>Again, antimony was undoubtedly discovered in the body,
and yet no one is known to have given it to Cook, unless
Palmer did so in the broth, the toast and water, and the coffee
that he pressed him to take, and provided for him. On the
question of motive so anxiously laboured by the defence, it
was enough simply to repeat, the amounts of the debts pressing
on Palmer, and to bear in mind how drowning men will
catch at a straw. Cook’s bets, which Palmer had collected,
staved off immediate pressure; and had not Mr. Stevens, whose
conduct as Cook’s relative the Attorney-General earnestly
defended, insisted on the <i>post-mortem</i>, and thus brought
about the inquest and this inquiry, it was possible that the insurance
office might have paid the policy on Walter’s life, and
the forged bills been thus redeemed in time to save exposure.
Cook also was valueless to help Palmer to keep these bills
alive; even Pratt, the 60 per cent. money-lender, would not
discount his acceptance for £500 without the security of a
bill of sale on his horses.</p>

<p>Better acquainted with turf doings than his opponent, the
Attorney-General smiled at the idea, that because a man was
another’s confederate on the turf therefore he made himself
responsible for his debts, or that Cook, with all his friendship
for Palmer, would beggar himself for his sake.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Joint engagement they had but one, the £500 bill secured on
Sirius and Polestar, and it was to meet this, and free his horses,
that Cook gave £300 out of his receipts at Shrewsbury to Palmer
to send up to Pratt, and wrote to Fisher to advance the other
£200. No £300 was sent up, and the £200, with the bets
collected by Herring, went not to free this bill, but to stop Pratt’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
action on the forged bill of £2000 of Palmer’s. It was no doubt
true that after a man’s death, his bets were irrecoverable and his
betting-book useless. It was, however, useful to enable Palmer
to give a list of bets to Herring to collect, the proceeds of which
were turned to his own use, and the previous collection of which
Palmer withheld from Stevens. In the same way would have
gone the cheque for £350 for the stakes&mdash;whether a forgery or not&mdash;but
for the accident of their not having paid over in time. Had
Cook lived, the closely approaching claim on his £500 acceptance,
which he believed to have been settled, would have revealed
the whole transaction.” [Again, the Attorney-General pressed
for the production of the £350 cheque filled up by Cheshire.]
“Why should Cheshire be asked to fill it up? Just about this time
Palmer was to meet Dr. Bamford and Jones in consultation&mdash;why
not ask Mr. Jones, the trusted friend of Cook, tell him the same
story as he did Cheshire, and not send for the latter? From the
day that this cheque was drawn till he was arrested on the bill,
Palmer had undisturbed possession of his own papers&mdash;from the
day of his arrest till his trial the papers had been in safe custody.
Why, then, is it not produced? Can you help drawing the inference
that the transaction will not bear the light? Look,
again, at the claim of £3000 or £4000 of bills on Cook’s estate,
the document Cheshire refused to witness, which is also not produced&mdash;the
letter to Pratt that he must have Polestar, and the
instructions not to give any information on Cook’s affairs. Can
you doubt that they were all part of one fraudulent and flagitious
design, for the full completion of which the death of Cook
was a necessary thing?”</p>

<p class="p1">Palmer’s conduct at the <i>post-mortem</i>, the tampering with
the cover of the jar&mdash;by whom?&mdash;his anxiety to upset
Mr. Stevens when in charge of it, because, it had been urged,
of “his prying meddlesome curiosity;” his presents and
letters to the coroner; his prompting Cheshire to tamper
with the letter from Dr. Taylor; his anxiety to know, and to
let the coroner know, that strychnia had not been found; his
suggestion to call Smith (what a witness Jeremiah would
have made!); his assertions of previous epileptic fits, and his
hope “that the verdict to-morrow would be that he died of
natural causes, and thus end it,” were all dwelt upon:
“little things, if taken individually, but taken as a whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>”
said the Attorney-General, “as I submit to you, leading
irresistibly to the conclusion of the guilt of this man.”</p>

<p>In concluding this masterly speech, though in some parts
too like fighting for a verdict, the Attorney-General criticised
the assertion by Serjeant Shee of his belief of the prisoner’s
innocence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You have, indeed, had introduced into this case one other
element, which I own, I think, had better have been omitted.
You have had from my learned friend the unusual, I think I may
say the unprecedented, assurance of his conviction of the innocence
of his client. I can only say upon that point that I think it would
have been better if my learned friend had abstained from giving
such an assurance. What would he think of me if, imitating his
example, I should at this moment declare to you, on my honour,
as he did, what is the intimate conviction which has followed from
my own conscientious consideration of this case? My learned
friend also, in his address, of which all admired the power and
ability, adopting a course which is sometimes resorted to by advocates,
but which, in my mind, involves more or less a species of
insult to the good sense or good feeling of the jury&mdash;endeavoured
to intimidate you, by an appeal to your consciences, from discharging
firmly and honestly the great and solemn duty which you are
called upon to perform. My learned friend told you that, if your
verdict in this case should be ‘guilty,’ the innocence of the prisoner
would one day be made manifest, and that you would never cease
to regret the verdict which you had given. If my learned friend
were sincere in that&mdash;and I know that he was, for there is no man
in whom the spirit of truth and honour is more keenly alive&mdash;if he
said what he believed, I can only answer that it shows how, when
a man enters upon the consideration of a case with a strong bias
on his mind, he is liable to err. I think then that my learned
friend had better have abstained from making any assurance which
involved his conviction of the prisoner’s innocence. I think,
further&mdash;in justice and consideration to you&mdash;that he should have
abstained from representing to you that the voice of the country
would not sanction the verdict which you might give. I say
nothing of the inconsistency which is involved in such a statement,
coming from one who but a short hour before had complained in
eloquent terms of the universal torrent of passion and of prejudice
by which he said that his client would be borne down; but in
answer to my learned friend I say this to you:&mdash;Pay no regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to the voice of the country, whether it be for condemnation or for
acquittal; pay no regard to anything but to the internal voice of
your own consciences, and to that sense of duty which you owe to
God and man upon this occasion, seeking no reward except the comforting
assurance that when you look back to the proceedings of
this day you will feel that you have discharged to the utmost of
your ability and to the best of your power the duty which it was
yours to perform. If on a review of this whole case, comparing the
evidence on one side and on the other, and weighing it in the even
scales of justice, you can come to the conclusion of innocence, or
can even entertain that fair and reasonable amount of doubt of
which the accused is entitled to the benefit, in God’s name acquit
him; but if, on the other hand, all the facts and all the evidence
lead your minds, with satisfaction to yourselves, to the conclusion
of his guilt, then&mdash;but then only&mdash;I ask for a verdict of ‘guilty’
at your hands. For the protection of the good, for the repression
of the wicked, I ask for that verdict by which alone&mdash;as it seems
to me&mdash;the safety of society can be secured, and the demands, the
imperious demands of public justice, can be satisfied.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p>As the learned Judge’s charge occupied the whole of the
eleventh and until half-past four on the twelfth day, and was
necessarily protracted by his reading in detail nearly all the
voluminous evidence to the jury, it would be impossible to
give it in full. I shall, therefore, limit this report to such
of his observations, as have not already been given in the
notes to the evidence of the various witnesses to whom they
applied.</p>

<p>Contrasting the practice in foreign countries of raising the
probability of guilt, from the fact of the previous commission
by a prisoner of other crimes against other persons, and even
of a totally different character to that with which he then
stands charged, Lord Campbell warned the jury that they
must deal with him now as if he were an entirely innocent
man, and confine their attention solely to the evidence bearing
on the crime itself. He warned them also that the
expression of his counsel’s opinion, that the prisoner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
innocent, meant no more than the plea of “Not Guilty,” and
that the most inconvenient consequences would follow from
regarding it in any other light. Neither was it necessary, as
a point of law, that the poison by which it was charged that
the murder was effected, should be found in the body, or
seen to be administered. They must look to the medical
evidence to see whether the death was from that poison, or
from natural causes, and to the moral evidence, whether that
showed that the prisoner not only had the opportunity, but
that he actually availed himself of that opportunity, and
administered the poison. He then proceeded to read over the
evidence, commencing with that showing the indebtedness of
Palmer to Pratt, in which Cook had no liability, and then
taking up the joint liability of Palmer and Cook to the same
person in connection with the loan secured on Cook’s horses.
With reference to the former transactions he called attention
to Palmer’s letter to Pratt, “not to let Cook’s friends know
what money Cook had ever had from him,” remarking, “that
it was written at a time when the stepfather was making
inquiries of a nature certainly very disagreeable to Palmer.”
On the latter correspondence he called attention to the cheque
for £375, sent by Pratt for Cook, on which Palmer wrote the
endorsement, and admitted “that it was very properly argued
for the defence, that it was possible that Cook had authorised
some one else to write it;” but coupled with it the circumstance
that on the 13th of November Palmer was in a state
of embarrassment, and that on the 20th he could pay Armshaw
two £50 notes, and that on the 22nd he could pay a further
£50.</p>

<p>After next reading the evidence of Wright, the attorney of
Birmingham, to show how heavily Palmer was indebted to
his brother, besides to Pratt, and alluding to the bill of sale
of all his property, he laid great stress on the non-production
of the cheque on Weatherby for £350, the production of
which would have settled the question whether or not it was
forged with the intention of appropriating it to his own use.
Mr. Serjeant Shee here interposing with the remark that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Weatherby thought the signature genuine, Lord Campbell
replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Mr. Weatherby said the body of the cheque was not in Cook’s
handwriting, and he had paid no attention to the signature. You,
gentlemen, must consider the evidence with regard to this part of
the case. The cheque is not produced, though it was sent back by
Weatherby to Palmer. It is not produced” [here the judge read
the evidence of the search for papers at Palmer’s]. “It might have
been expected that the cheque so returned to Palmer, who professed
to set store upon it, and to have given value for it, would
have been found, but it is not forthcoming. It is for you to draw
whatever inference may suggest itself to you from this circumstance.”</p>

<p class="p1">The judge then alluded to the fact of Palmer remaining in
the neighbourhood after suspicion had been excited against
him, as of importance, and worthy of being taken into consideration,
though, as he added, “he might have done so,
perhaps, thinking that from the care he had taken nothing
would be discovered against him,” and that neither the bills
nor the document by which Cook was said to have admitted
his liability on them were produced, and closed this portion
of the evidence.</p>

<p>On the incident of the brandy-and-water at Shrewsbury,
the learned judge remarked, “What a mysterious circumstance
it was, that Cook, after he had stated his suspicions,
still retained his confidence in Palmer&mdash;was still constantly
in his company&mdash;during the few remaining days of his life,
still sent for him whenever in distress; and, in fact, seemed
to a great extent to be under his influence.” In a subsequent
part of his charge, when dealing with the evidence for the
defence, he contrasted the evidence of Myatt in contradiction
to that of Brooks and Fisher, and left the jury to draw their
own conclusion which they would believe. Cook’s letter to
Fisher to pay Pratt the £200 was also here read and commented
on, and the jury left to infer why he did not go to
London as he proposed, and why he put the collection of his
bets in Herring’s hands instead of Fisher’s&mdash;“if he did so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming now to the illness at Rugeley, he said, “he was
bound to declare that not one fact had been adduced to prove
that Mills had been bribed, or that Mr. Stevens had read
over the newspaper to her, to influence her evidence in a
particular direction: it was a gratuitous assertion, unsupported
by evidence, and distinctly denied.” Whether the
difference of Palmer’s dress when he ran over, as described
by Mills or Barnes, was of sufficient importance, was a
question for the jury, and also whether Mills’s deposition
before the coroner, and her evidence in Court (the deposition
was read) was not substantially the same. On the letter
from Palmer calling in Jones, cited by the defence as a proof
of innocence, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is important, however, to consider at what period of Cook’s
illness Jones was sent for, and in what condition he was when
Jones arrived. Palmer’s assertion in the letter was, that Cook had
been suffering from diarrhœa, and of this statement we have not
the slightest confirmation in the evidence. When Jones, looking
at Cook’s tongue, observed it was not the tongue of a bilious
attack, Palmer’s reply was, ‘You should have seen it before.’
What reason could Palmer have for using these words, when there
is not the slightest evidence of Cook having suffered from such an
illness?” Then, having had Jones’s deposition before the coroner
read, he added, “It is for you to say whether in your opinion this
deposition at all varies from his evidence given here: I confess
that I see no variation, and no reason to suppose that his evidence
is not the evidence of sincerity and truth.”</p>

<p class="p1">After observing that the evidence of Dr. Savage showed
that previous to his departure for Shrewsbury Cook was in
better health than he had been for a long time, the learned
judge read the evidence of Newton, and his deposition before
the coroner. Remarking on his omitting to mention the first
purchase of strychnia until the Tuesday morning, when
coming to London, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You will observe that though there has been an omission, there
is no contradiction. You are then to consider what is the probability
of his inventing this wicked lie&mdash;a most important lie, if lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
it be. He had no ill will towards the prisoner at the bar, he had
never quarrelled with him, and had nothing to get by injuring him.
I cannot see any motive for his inventing a lie to take away the
life of the prisoner. No inducement was held out to him by the
Crown. He says himself that no inducement was held out to him,
and that at last he disclosed this circumstance from a sense of duty.
If you believe his evidence, it is very strong against the prisoner.”
And then, reading the evidence of Roberts and remarking that he
was not cross-examined or in any way contradicted, he added&mdash;“If
you couple that with the statement of Newton&mdash;believing that
statement&mdash;you have evidence of strychnia having been procured
by the prisoner on the Monday night before the symptoms of
strychnia were exhibited by Cook; and by the evidence of Roberts,
undenied and unquestioned, that on Tuesday six grains of strychnia
were supplied to him. Supposing you should come to the conclusion
that the symptoms of Cook were consistent with strychnia,
then a case is made out for the Crown. The learned counsel did
not favour us with the theory he had formed in his own mind with
respect to that strychnia. There is no evidence&mdash;there is no suggestion&mdash;how
it was applied; what became of it.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> That must not
influence your verdict, unless you come to the conclusion that
Cook’s symptoms were consistent with death by strychnia. <i>But if
you come to that conclusion, I should shrink from my duty&mdash;I
should be unworthy to sit here&mdash;if I did not call your attention to the
inference, that if he purchased that strychnia, he purchased it for the
purpose of administering it to Cook.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">Then, after vindicating the conduct of Mr. Stevens in
relation to the loss of the betting-book, Lord Campbell
alluded to the pushing of the jar, at the <i>post-mortem</i>, as
probably an accident, and its removal as “nothing more than
the pushing, were it not coupled with evidence afterwards
given, which might lead to the inference that there was a
plan to destroy it and prevent the analysis of its contents.”
He saw no reason to doubt the evidence of the postboy, and
did not believe that Stevens had given Palmer such provocation
as to induce him to offer Myatt a bribe to upset him.
“That is not indeed a decisive proof of guilt, but it is for you
to say whether the prisoner did not enter on that contrivance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to prevent an opportunity of examining the jar, which might
contain evidence against him.”</p>

<p>Cheshire’s evidence as to filling up the cheque, and being
asked to witness Cook’s signature, as if he was present, to
the document professing to admit his liability on Palmer’s
bills; his subsequent dealing with Dr. Taylor’s letter to
Mr. Gardner; Palmer’s letter to the coroner stating the result
of the analysis; his presents to the coroner; and his instructions
to Bate not to let anyone see him deliver his letter to
Mr. Ward, together with the instructions to Herring about
Cook’s bets, were then carefully reviewed before entering on
the medico-scientific evidence offered on the part of the
prosecution.</p>

<p>The evidence of this class of witnesses has been so fully
reported, that it is needless to repeat the Judge’s passing
comments on their descriptions of the symptoms of tetanus
as consistent with those in Cook’s case, and with those
exhibited in the cases of undoubted poisoning by strychnia,
detailed by the medical men who had attended the several
patients. With reference to the results of the analysis by
Drs. Taylor and Rees, and of the effect of their evidence, the
learned Judge made the following comment on their experiments
on animals:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“There is here a most important question for your consideration.
Great reliance is placed by the prisoner’s counsel, and very
naturally so, upon the fact that no trace of strychnia was detected
in the stomach of Cook by Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees, who alone
analysed it and experimented upon it. But, on the other hand,
you must bear in mind that we have their own evidence to show
that there may be and have been cases of death by strychnia in
which the united skill of these two individuals has failed to detect
the presence of the strychnia after death. Both Dr. Taylor and
Dr. Rees have stated upon their oaths that in two cases where
they knew death to have been occasioned by strychnia&mdash;the poison
having, in fact, been administered with their own hands&mdash;they
failed to discover the slightest trace of the poison in the dead
bodies of the animals on which they had experimented. It is possible
that other chemists might have succeeded in detecting
strychnia in those animals and strychnia also in the jar containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the stomach and intestines of Cook; but, however this may be, it
is beyond all question that Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees failed to discover
the faintest indications of strychnia in the bodies of two
animals which they had themselves poisoned with that deadly
drug. Whatever may be the nature of the different theories propounded
for the explanation of this fact, the fact itself is deposed
to on oath; and, if we believe the witnesses, does not admit of
doubt.” With regard to the letter from Dr. Taylor to Mr. Gardner,
stating that neither strychnia, prussic acid, nor opium had been
found in the body, his lordship said, “this letter was written before
Cook’s symptoms had been communicated to them; but they had
been informed that prussic acid, strychnia, and opium had been
bought by Palmer on the Tuesday. They searched for all these
poisons, and found none. The only poison they found was
antimony, and they did not, therefore, in the absence of symptoms,
attribute death to strychnia, as they could not at that time; but
they say it might have been produced by antimony, as they say
that the quantity found in the body was no test of the quantity
taken into the system.”&mdash;“For the discovery of strychnia Dr.
Taylor experimented upon the bodies of animals which he had
himself killed by this poison, but in them no strychnia could be
found. I do not know what interest Dr. Taylor could be supposed
to have to give evidence against the prisoner. He was regularly
employed by the Crown, and knew nothing of Palmer until he was
called upon by Mr. Stevens, and the jar was given to him. He
could have no enmity against the prisoner and no interest whatever
to misrepresent facts.” [On being reminded that Dr. Taylor’s
experiments on the two rabbits were not made until after the
inquest,] “that,” said Lord Campbell, “makes no difference. If
that experiment was made this morning the fact would be the
same. Against Dr. Rees there is not even the imputation of having
written an indiscreet letter to a newspaper. Yet Dr. Rees concurs
with Dr. Taylor, that these rabbits were killed by strychnia; that
they did whatever was in their power, according to their skill and
knowledge, to discover strychnia, as they did with the contents of
the jar, and that no strychnia could be discovered. As to antimony,
he corroborates the testimony of Dr. Taylor. Antimony is a component
of tartar emetic; tartar emetic produces vomiting, and you
will judge from the vomiting at Shrewsbury and Rugeley whether
antimony may have been administered to Cook at those places.
Antimony may not have produced death, but the question of its
administration is a part of the case which you must most seriously
consider.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Having then read the evidence of Professor Brande, Dr.
Christison, and Dr. John Jackson, Lord Campbell, at eight
o’clock, reserved the evidence for the defence to the next day.</p>

<p>On resuming his charge the next morning, Lord Campbell
commenced by a brief summary of his previous remarks.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The evidence for the prosecution certainly did present a serious
case against the prisoner. It appeared that in November last he
was most seriously embarrassed, and that he had to make payments
for which he was entirely unprepared. There were actions against
himself and his mother, and he had no credit left in any quarter.
Cook by the races at Shrewsbury became master of £1000, and the
inference had been drawn that Palmer formed a design of appropriating
it to his own purposes, in order to relieve himself from his
embarrassments. Again, it was proved that the prisoner drew a
cheque in the name of Cook which was a forgery, for the purpose
of appropriating to himself Cook’s property. What would have
been the effect of the survival of Cook under those circumstances
it would be for the jury to consider. No doubt, if Cook had lived,
that cheque would have been brought forward, and would have led
to an exposure of all Palmer’s delinquencies. With respect to
the joint liability of Cook and Palmer, it was said that it was
disadvantageous to Palmer that Cook should die; but there
seemed to be some doubt whether it was not the intention of
Palmer to possess himself of the whole of Cook’s property, and in
that case he had a direct interest in his death. Then as to the
medical evidence which had been adduced for the prosecution.
The jury had heard the evidence of able and honourable men, who
said that the deceased did not die a natural death, and that the
symptoms were consistent with death by strychnia, and not consistent
with death by ordinary <i>tetanus</i>. There was no point of law
which required that the strychnia should be found in the body of
the deceased, and it would therefore be for the jury on this point
to consider whether the evidence of the prosecution was sufficient,
or whether they could rely upon the answer which had been put in
by the defence. There was direct evidence that the prisoner
procured the poison of strychnia on Monday and Tuesday. What
he did with it was not for him in that place to affirm. It was
impossible for the jury not to pay attention to the conduct of the
prisoner before and after the death of Cook, and they would not
fail to consider, as part of those circumstances, his very remarkable
proceedings in reference to the betting-book, which had never been
discovered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He then proceeded to consider the evidence tendered by
medical and scientific experts for the defence.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Then as to the evidence which had been put in for the defence,
the jury had had before them gentlemen of great ability and high
honour, who had given in detail the results of their experience.
With that evidence he would now proceed to deal.” [The learned
judge read in extenso the voluminous evidence of Mr. Nunneley,
the surgeon, of Leeds.] “The jury had heard the manner in which
Mr. Nunneley had given his evidence, and they must form their
own opinion of it. Certainly he seemed to display an interest in
the case not altogether consistent with the character of a witness.
He differed very much from several witnesses who were examined
for the prosecution, and particularly in reference to rigidity being
produced by strychnia after death. These and similar questions
were for the jury. The next witness who was examined was
Mr. Herapath, of Bristol, a very eminent analytical chemist, who
had paid great attention to the subject of poisons. That gentleman
said that where there had been death by strychnia it ought
to be discovered. But it appeared, on cross-examination, that he
had expressed an opinion, on another occasion, that Cook died from
strychnia, but that Dr. Taylor had not taken the proper means to
find it. After adverting to the evidence of Mr. Rogers, his lordship
read that of Dr. Letheby, of the London Hospital, the medical
officer of the City of London, of whom he said that he seemed to
prove that cases of this sort were very variable, and that he
admitted that the Romsey case was an exception. Now, while
these exceptional cases existed, it could hardly be said that the
principles laid down by Dr. Letheby were sufficient to rebut the
evidence in chief. His lordship next referred to Mr. Gay’s case of
the omnibus conductor. This, he said, was a case of idiopathic
tetanus. The jury would say, on comparing it with the symptoms
in Cook’s case, whether his was also a case of idiopathic tetanus.
The great weight of evidence seemed to show that Cook’s was not
a case of idiopathic any more than it was a case of traumatic
tetanus. Mr. Gay’s case differed altogether from that of Cook, and
as far as he could see there was no analogy between them. Passing
next to the evidence of Mr. Ross, and to his case of a man, who
died from ulcers, his lordship remarked that he did not see why
this case was brought before the Court unless to prove that Cook’s
was of the same sort. This was a case, whether of idiopathic or
traumatic tetanus, in which it was sought to prove that death was
caused by bruises on the body. But there were no bruises of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sort about Cook, and therefore the analogy failed. In reference to
the important evidence of Dr. Wrightson, who said he had
detected strychnia in putrifying blood and decomposed matter, and
that strychnia did not under such circumstances decompose, he
must say that this witness was a scientific and honourable man,
and had spoken throughout with proper caution. According to
Dr. Wrightson, the discovery of the poison should have been
proved, but at the same time his evidence did not overthrow the
case for the prosecution; and it would be for the jury to say
whether, in the event of poison actually being in the body, the
tests employed to detect it were sufficient. Referring to the evidence
of Mr. Partridge, his lordship said that the witness had
stated that the symptoms in Cook’s case did not correspond with
what he should have expected to have found from strychnia, but
he spoke from his own experience, and he admitted that the
symptoms were very variable; and he did not seem, therefore, to
speak with any degree of certainty upon the subject. Mr. Gay’s
case of a boy who suffered from tetanus from an injury to his toe
was, his lordship thought, not at all analogous to that of Cook;
nor was that of the young woman who had an attack of tetanus
without any apparent cause, and recovered, as deposed to by Dr.
McDonald. The last witness had given his opinion that Cook died
from epileptic convulsions, accompanied with tetanic complications,
and this he thought might have been produced by mental or
sensual excitement. The jury would see to what length this
witness went, and it would be for the jury to say what weight they
attached to his evidence. Having adverted to several cases adduced
by the defence, and which his lordship considered bore no analogy
to Cook’s, he read the evidence of Dr. Robinson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
who ascribed the death to epilepsy. He then passed on to
Dr. Richardson, who narrated the particulars of a remarkable case
of angina pectoris, to the symptoms of which disease he said Cook’s
bore a remarkable resemblance. The witness, his lordship said,
seemed a most respectable man, and he said that the symptoms in
this case were consistent with those arising from strychnia, and
that if he had known as much of strychnia at that time as he did
now, he should have searched for it in that case. It would be for
the jury to consider whether Cook’s symptoms were consistent with
strychnia, and if so, that ought to lead them as to the opinion
they should form on the case. His lordship having adverted to the
evidence of Catharine Watson, the girl who was attacked with
tetanus in Scotland, and to other witnesses who were recalled, said
this was all the medical evidence that had been adduced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
counsel for the defence of the prisoner. But then, gentlemen,
said Lord Campbell, comes that most important question, whether
the symptoms of the deceased were consistent with death by
poisoning with strychnia. You will say whether your opinion upon
that subject is altered by the evidence given on the part of the
prisoner. Several of the witnesses called by the prisoner seem to
admit (although, of course, you will form your own judgment upon
it) that those symptoms were consistent with strychnia, although,
in the absence of evidence to show that strychnia was administered,
they could not come to such a conclusion.”</p>

<p class="p1">Lord Campbell’s subsequent remarks on the witnesses who
were called to contradict those for the prosecution as to the
state of Cook’s health, the incident of the brandy and water
at Shrewsbury, and the possibility of Palmer arriving in
Rugeley from London at the time spoken to by Newton, have
already been given in previous notes. In conclusion, he said,</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The conduct of the prisoner in requesting to have the body
fastened up, with respect to the betting book, and the tampering
with the coroner, remained unanswered, as did also the bribe offered
to the postboy. No explanation was offered as to the strychnia purchased
by the prisoner on the Tuesday morning, the proof of which
stands uncontradicted; no evidence has been given of any purpose
to which it was to be applied, and no explanation of what became
of that poison. The case was now before the jury. They must
not act upon suspicion, or even strong suspicion, and they must
only pronounce a verdict of guilty if their minds were made up.
If, however, they could come to the conclusion that he was guilty,
they would return such a verdict unfettered and undeterred by any
intimidation.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee</i> objected to the question put to the jury by
the judge. He submitted that the question, whether the symptoms
of Cook’s death were consistent with death by strychnia was a
wrong one, unless coupled with the words “and inconsistent with
death from natural causes,” and that the question should then be
“whether the medical evidence established beyond all reasonable
doubt that the death of Cook was attributable to strychnia.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Alderson.</i>&mdash;“That is the question that has been put.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Shee</i> submitted that the question whether the
symptoms were consistent with strychnia ought not to have been
put.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lord Campbell.</i>&mdash;“ I have told the jury that, unless they think
the symptoms described agree with the supposition that the
deceased died from strychnia, they must acquit the prisoner.”</p>

<p><i>Baron Alderson.</i>&mdash;“That has been stated in the speech.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">After some further remarks from Mr. Serjeant Shee, Lord
Campbell told the jury that not only must they be satisfied
that the symptoms described agreed with the supposition that
the deceased died from strychnia, but that it was administered
by the prisoner.</p>

<p>The jury retired at 2.20, and at 3.45 returned a verdict of
guilty, and Lord Campbell passed sentence of death, to be
carried out at Stafford jail.</p>

<p>The prisoner heard the sentence perfectly unmoved. At
one time he drew himself up, as if about to make some
remark, but did not attempt to speak. He stood quite calm,
and when his Lordship had concluded, turned round and
walked from the dock with the same coolness as he had shown
during the whole of his protracted trial.</p>

<p>Contrasting the procedure in this memorable trial with
what it might and no doubt would have been in a criminal
court in France, Mr. Justice Stephen makes the following
remarks:&mdash;“Not less remarkable than the careful way in
which all topics of prejudice were avoided was the extreme
fulness and completeness of the evidence as to facts really
relevant to the case. Nothing was omitted which the jury
could properly want to know, nor anything which the prisoner
could possibly wish to say. No case could set in a clearer
light the characteristic features of English Criminal Law&mdash;namely,
its essentially litigious character, and the way in
which it deals with scientific evidence. A study of the case
will show, first, that evidence could not be more condensed,
more complete, more clearly directed to the point at issue;
secondly, that the subjection of all the witnesses, and especially
the scientific witnesses, to the most rigorous cross-examination
is absolutely essential to the trustworthiness of
their evidence. The clearness and skill with which the
various witnesses, especially those for the defence, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
cross-examined, and forced to admit that they could not really
distinguish the symptoms of Cook from those of poisoning by
strychnia, was such an illustration of the efficiency of cross-examination
as is rarely indeed afforded.”</p>

<p>“The defence was by far the least impressive part of the
trial, but that was mainly because there was nothing to say. It
was impossible to suggest any innocent explanation of Palmer’s
conduct. It was proved to demonstration that he was in dire
need of money in order to avoid a prosecution for forgery;
that he robbed his friend of all he had by a series of devices
which he must instantly have discovered if he had lived; that
he provided himself with the means of committing the murder
just before Cook’s death; and that he could neither produce
the poison he had bought, nor suggest any innocent reason
for buying it. There must have been some mystery in the
case which has never been discovered. Palmer, at and before
his death, was repeatedly pressed to say whether he was guilty
or not, and told that everyone would believe him guilty if he
did not emphatically deny it. He could only say Cook was
not poisoned by strychnia, and I have reason to know that he
was anxious that Mr. Herapath should examine the body for
strychnia, though aware that he could detect the 1-50,000th
part of a grain. He may have discovered some way of administering
it which would render detection impossible, but
it is difficult to doubt that he used it; for if not, why buy
it?”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><i>William Dove</i>, aged 30, was indicted for the murder of his
wife, on the 1st of March, 1856, at Leeds.</p></div>

<p class="psh">EARLY LIFE OF THE PRISONER.</p>

<p>The prisoner, the son of a respectable leather manufacturer
at Leeds, had been, from his childhood to his seventh year,
more than usually fractious, mischievous, ill-natured, and irrational
in his tricks: putting lighted candles more than once
in a basket and locking them in a cupboard: pouring some
kind of spirits on his bedroom curtains and setting them on
fire: chasing his sisters with a red-hot poker and threatening
to burn them: hanging a cat by its tail out of window: cutting
himself with knives and writing his name with his blood:
an irregular and inapt scholar, especially in his religion.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
The usher at his first school, where he was from the age of
ten to thirteen years, regarded him “as a boy of very low
intellect, great inability of mind, great want of moral power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
evil and vicious propensities. Once, when he had got a
pistol, he told his schoolfellows he was going to shoot his
father&mdash;a dull boy, and a had boy. I then thought him
insane, but did not feel myself in a position to object to his
being flogged.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Mr. Highley, the master of this school,
spoke strongly of Dove’s bad conduct, which he attributed to
his reasoning powers being very limited. “He appeared,”
said the witness, “to have no idea of any consequences; to be
deprived of reason. I am satisfied he was labouring under
an aberration of intellect.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Having been expelled from his
school, his father took the opinion of a Mr. Lord, a schoolmaster,
as to what was best to be done with the boy. “I
could make no impression on his heart or his head,” said
Mr. Lord. “He could not appreciate what I said. He
listened, but I could make no impression&mdash;get no rational
answers. When I heard of his engagement I told his
future wife’s brother-in-law that inquiry ought to be made
about Dove on account of his unaccountable irrational
conduct.” By Mr. Lord’s advice, he was sent to learn
farming, for more than five years, with a Mr. Frankish.
Here again his mischievous and cruel propensities were
exhibited&mdash;putting vitriol on the tails of some cows, burning
half-grown kittens with it, putting it into the horse-trough,
and setting fire to the gorse. He was as unapt a scholar at
farming as at religion and grammar. Again, when he went
to another farmer for a year, he was the same dull unpractical
pupil. He was now sent to America for a short visit,
returning with travellers’ stories of his adventures of unusual
wildness and incredibility. Still, however, he was deemed
by his father capable of being trusted with a farm, where his
mischievous and extravagant conduct astonished his servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and made them regard him as “not of a sound mind.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> At
this time, 1852, he married, quarrelling or playing with his
wife like a child, and changed his farm more than once,
without apparent reason. Other witnesses spoke to the
incoherence of his conversation: of his lying on the ground
and crying without a cause; complaining of noises in his
house; trying to reap his own corn in a green state; exhibiting
conjuring tricks, and talking of having put a spell on the
steward of the proprietor of one of his farms. Eventually,
in consequence of his intemperate habits, he had to give up
farming and remove into the outskirts of Leeds, where he
lived on an annuity of £90 a year, left to him by his father,
who died in 1854. With nothing to do, he became an habitual
drunkard, aggravating his eccentricities, stimulating his mischievous
propensities, and stupefying himself as to the
consequences of his actions to himself.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> With such propensities,
it may be conceived that his wife led a wretched
life; that quarrels were frequent; that at one time he
threatened her with a pistol; and that eventually, after a very
few years, they occupied separate beds, and rarely met, except
at meals. Unfortunately for both of them, an arrangement
for a separation was broken off by the interposition of
injudicious friends, and until the beginning of 1856 they
endured their miserable life together.</p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the enquiries into the death of
Cook at Rugeley were filling the newspapers, and the evidence
on the inquest became matter of popular discussion. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Dove’s friends was one Harrison, known as the Witchman of
Leeds, who, according to his own account, was “a dentist, a
water caster, a caster of nativities, and a believer in the
stars.” On hearing this man read, in a public-house, the
results of the analytical examination of Cook’s body by
Dr. Taylor, as related at the inquest, and that gentleman’s
statement of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of discovering
strychnia by chemical analysis, Dove appears to have been
forcibly struck by the revelation. He asked Harrison either
to make or get him some strychnia, and, when he refused,
said he could get it elsewhere. Probably at that time the
idea of poisoning his wife was first entertained by him.
Unfortunately he had no difficulty in obtaining the necessary
poison, as he was intimately acquainted with Mr. Morley, the
surgeon of Leeds, who had attended the Dove family for
many years, and was a constant visitor to his surgery. Subsequently,
therefore, to his acquiring knowledge of what had
happened in Palmer’s case, he had repeated conversations with
one of Mr. Morley’s pupils about strychnia; and on the 10th
of February, on the plea that his house was infested by rats,
and that he was worried by his neighbour’s cats, he obtained
from him ten grains of this deadly poison. This he placed
about the house in a careless way, and destroyed a cat, the
body of which he buried in the midden. Again on the 17th
he got four or five grains more of strychnia, promising the
pupil who gave it to him the skin of a grey cat which he professed
to be about to poison with it. At this time, the pupil
was of opinion that Dove noted whereabouts on the shelf the
bottle of strychnia was placed. A few days after he was seen
by Mr. Morley’s coachman in the surgery alone, with the gas
turned up, which, as the coachman came near, he turned down,
and in an apparent flurry, meeting him at the door, gave as
his excuse that he had come to light his pipe.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The suggestion
of the prosecution was that at this time, knowing where
the bottle of strychnia was kept, he took the opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
helping himself to some more of the poison. During all this
time it was evident, from his conversations on strychnia and
the impossibility of its detection, that he had studied Palmer’s
case.</p>

<p>Previously to Sunday, the 24th of February, Mrs. Dove
had not been well, but on that day appeared quite recovered.
On the Monday, however, when she went upstairs with her
servant to make the beds, she was suddenly taken ill,
staggered, became paralysed, twitched and jumped, and when
put on the bed, on the slightest touch either of her body or
the bedclothes, had renewed convulsions. Dove, who was
downstairs, was sent for, and went for the doctor, to whom he
said that his wife had been ill all night, and asked if his wife
died would there be a coroner’s inquest?<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> After two or three
hours the convulsions passed away, and the patient remained
free from pain. Dove’s attention to his wife was suspiciously
marked. He gave her medicine with his own hands; called
in a neighbour to attend to her, and seemed greatly distressed
at her condition. Three days after, a second attack of the same
nature occurred, and again he told the doctor he was sure his
wife would die. She was seen to cry bitterly, and heard to
say that she was sure the medicine, of the bitter taste of
which she complained, was killing her. Next evening a third
attack came on, with the same symptoms. And on the 28th
Dove predicted that she would have another attack about ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that evening; at that hour he gave her the medicine, and in
half an hour afterwards another and more severe attack came
on, so severe that she said, “Oh dear, I thought it was all
over.” In all these attacks after a time the spasms and convulsions
passed away, and she was apparently only suffering
from exhaustion after them, and otherwise quite well. On
Saturday Dove, who had gone out, returned much in liquor,
and at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> gave her her medicine. “It is very disagreeable,”
she said, “hot and bitter.” He washed out the glass
and wiped it as usual, saying, “I always wash it out; medicine
is always such nasty stuff.” Within half an hour of taking
this dose an attack more than usually violent came on, and
after a series of spasms and convulsions the poor creature
died about twenty minutes to eleven that night.</p>

<p>Struck with the resemblance of the symptoms of Mrs. Dove’s
attacks to those due to poisoning by strychnia, and hearing
from his pupil of the purchase of that drug by the prisoner,
Mr. Morley, who had attended her, decided on having a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination. This Dove, who had on her first attack
asked Morley’s pupil whether Mr. Morley would have a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination if his wife died, tried to prevent, on
the plea of his having promised his wife that it should not
be allowed, and his horror at the desecration of her body.
Mr. Morley, however, obtained the consent of Dove’s mother,
and persevered. On the examination of the body by himself
and Mr. Nunneley, the surgeon, and the subsequent chemical
analysis of its different parts, every test proved the presence
of strychnia in large quantities. During the examination of
the body, blood to the extent of a crown piece fell on the floor
of the room, and a week after the spaniel of a woman who
was cleaning the room was supposed to have licked it, and as
she left on the completion of her work, was attacked with
violent spasms, fell on its back, and died at once. On the
examination of its body strychnia was also detected. The
prisoner, who after his wife’s funeral had wandered about, asking
Harrison and other persons whether it was safe to go back,
and talking about the possibility of the wife having taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
strychnia by accident, as he had carelessly placed it in his razor
case, and put it about in the house, was subsequently arrested
and put upon his trial. It is needless to give in detail the
evidence of the persons by whom the above facts were proved,
which were hardly traversed by counsel for the defence. The
testimony with reference to the symptoms and the results of
the <i>post-mortem</i> examination cannot, however, with safety be
abridged, seeing the importance attached to this case in
Palmer’s trial.</p>

<p class="psh">THE SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p><i>Ann Fisher</i>, who took her daughter’s place in the house in
consequence of the latter’s illness, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Saturday and Sunday Mrs. Dove appeared pretty well, and
on the latter day went to church. On Monday, February 25, after
breakfast, she complained of her legs, and said she felt curious, and
fell in the bedroom whilst helping witness to make the beds. Witness
caught her in her arms, and called up Dove, who went for
Mrs. Witham (next door neighbour), and witness put Mrs. Dove
to bed. <i>She started, and twitched, and jumped, and, even if witness
touched the bedclothes, or walked across the room, complained that it
made her worse.</i> Mr. Scarth (Morley’s assistant) came and gave
some medicine, and she felt better. The jerkings continued from
two to two and a half hours. She lay on her right side, and her
breathing was rather difficult: she was quite sensible the whole
time. She seemed better in the afternoon, and pretty well the
next morning. On Wednesday, the 27th, <i>she had another attack,
beating, jumping, and starting; complained about her legs and back
being very bad: said there was a stiffness in them; they seemed paralysed,
and she could not move them about</i>. <i>She lay on her side, and
her breathing was</i> very bad when she had these attacks on her.
She was better after the medicines on the two occasions on which
I gave them to her myself. I cannot recollect Thursday, but on
Friday night, about 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, I was called up into the bedroom.
Dove was dressed, standing by the bedside holding her hand. <i>Her
back was quite arched, and she was making a great noise in her
inside. She said, ‘Oh dear, I thought it had been my last.’ Her
breathing was very difficult. She complained about her jaws being
stiff.</i> I stayed with her till about 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and she was better, and
I went to bed. Next morning she said she was very poorly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
could not take any coffee. She had had no rest all night. She
took some coffee afterwards, and had a little rest. In the afternoon
Mrs. Witham was with her. She appeared much better then,
washed herself <i>and rubbed her legs, which seemed to ease her</i>. She
became worse at 8.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The bell was rung: Mrs. Wood and
Mrs. Witham were with her. Dove was out&mdash;had gone out about
a quarter to half an hour. <i>She then moaned and screamed; her
body was quite arched and her feet projected right from her body,
and she was in that state till twenty minutes to eleven, when she died.</i>
Before she died she grasped the hands of Mrs. Wood and
Mrs. Witham, who were holding hers, so hard that it hurt them.
Dove came back at about ten: she was then in great agony. As
soon as he saw me, he told me he was going to Mr. Morley’s for
medicine, and that if Mrs. Wood wanted to go home, I was to go
up and take her place. When he returned with the doctors, she
was dead.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mrs. Witham</i>,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the next door neighbour who attended the
deceased almost daily, confirmed Mrs. Fisher’s account of the
earlier symptoms, and gave the following details of the night
of her death:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Saturday, March the 1st, I saw her again about 2.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
She seemed better, and I remained with her till about six. At
3.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I gave her her medicine. Mr. Morley came at four,
when she seemed well. I got the food he ordered for her, and she
seemed better than I had seen her before. Dove was there, and
when I told him I had given her the medicine, he said she ought
not to have it until about five. I was sent for again later to sit
with her until Mrs. Fisher came, as Dove was going for medicine.
<i>He was rubbing her legs</i>, and asked her to kiss him, which she did.
Shortly after, he gave her her medicine. He went to the washstand,
and came back with a glass in one hand, with the medicine
and water in the other. He was at the washstand time enough
to pour out the medicine. Mrs. Wood was present. After she
had taken it, Mrs. Dove complained that it was very hot, and
asked for a lozenge. <i>Dove took the glass to the washstand, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
he always washed it out after giving the medicine.</i> He then left, as
he said, to get more medicine. In about a quarter of an hour <i>she
complained of her back: her head was thrown back. I took hold of
her hand, and she grasped it so tightly I could not get it away. Her
eyes looked fixed. I put my hand to them: they did not move. Her
features were very much distorted, and her teeth clinched. We both
took hold of her hands, which she grasped so tightly that I could not
bear it. Mrs. Wood was going to rub her back. She said, ‘Oh,
don’t; lift me up,’ and I and Mrs. Wood tried to do so. Her back
was arched, her body quite stiff, her legs stretched out. I did not
notice her feet. We lifted her up, and put a pillow under her back.
She rested on her shoulders, and the bottom part of her back, until the
pillow was placed under her. The symptoms grew more violent, but
she could speak. Her breathing was loud and difficult. She shrieked
several times&mdash;a sort of scream. In about half an hour she could
speak no longer. We could not be positive if she was sensible, and at
twenty minutes to eleven she died.</i> Dove came in after she had
ceased to speak, threw off his coat, and was going to rub her legs,
when I said she could not bear it. Mrs. Wood said something to
him, and he left the house immediately. When the doctors came
she had been dead some minutes.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> the witness said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That when she gave her the medicine about three o’clock,
deceased complained that it was bitter, as witness found it was on
tasting it: (it contained aloes). That when the attack came on she
appeared to lose her senses very soon, her eyes being fixed, and
not speaking: this was in about an hour. She spoke until half an
hour after her attack, but not until forty minutes. She was in
better health and spirits on the Saturday than she had been all
the week. <i>She was rubbed after each fit, and it seemed to relieve her.
The jumpings and twitchings went on, on the Saturday, and she was
then some hours still, and then they began again.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mrs. Wood</i> added the following particulars of the last
attack:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I went at twenty minutes to eight on the Saturday evening
and found her sitting up; her husband and Mrs. Witham were
with her. About eight she asked her husband for her medicine;
he went out of the room to get it, and returned in about a minute
with it, and gave it to her. She said it was very bitter, very hot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and very nasty, and that she thought she would get better if the
attack did not return. I recommended her to try and put it off.
<i>In about a quarter of an hour after taking the medicine she began to
be ill. I asked Mrs. Witham to go round and take her hand, saying,
‘this Gird is coming on.’ She was propped up with pillows. In a
short time she said, ‘Off the bed’ and repeated it three times. I
thought at that time she wished to get off the bed. Mrs. Witham
said, ‘Oh no, we cannot.’ I do not think she was sensible after she
said ‘Off the bed’ the first time.</i> She died at twenty minutes
to eleven. Dove went for the doctors; when he returned she was
dead.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Scarth</i>, Morley’s pupil, who attended on the 25th of
February, at the request of the prisoner, in Mr. Morley’s
absence, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I found Mrs. Dove in bed <i>with very minute twitchings of
the muscles of the face and arms, and her teeth closed&mdash;hands clinched&mdash;head
thrown slightly back, and the shoulders likewise, and her feet
stretched straight out with the legs</i>. Again I saw her at seven on the
Thursday night, <i>the symptoms were the same, but her principal complaint
was of pain in the shoulders and back</i>. <i>Her shoulders were
thrown back.</i> The attack passed off whilst I was there in about
five minutes. I gave her the draught prescribed by Mr. Morley,
and the convulsions ceased and did not return, and I ordered her
the repetition of the draught.”</p>

<p class="p1">This witness had the cat dug out of the midden, in which
the prisoner said he had buried it, and was present when
Mr. Morley and Mr. Nunneley experimented on it.</p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>Mr. George Morley</i>, a surgeon at Leeds, who had always
attended the Dove family, was called in to the deceased in
December, 1855, when he found her suffering from disordered
digestion and nervous excitement. She improved, and he
subsequently only saw her at long intervals till the 25th of
February; on that day, he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I found her in bed, and only observed <i>twitchings of the arms
twice</i>. She told me she had had an attack in the morning with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
pains in the back and limbs, and had been often before so, and
that she suffered from an excitable temperament. I thought it an
hysterical attack, as she was at the age for them. Saw her every
day during the week, and on the Wednesday and Thursday again
<i>saw slight jerking of the arms</i>. On the Friday and Saturday she
was decidedly better, and I did not alter my opinion of her case
until the Saturday night, as I had often seen such symptoms arise
from hysteria. I made the medicines antispasmodic and sedative:
they would check the symptoms, and for a time seemed to do so.
On Wednesday I proposed seeing another doctor, when Dove
said she would not recover, and I warned him not to say so in her
hearing, and that he had better call in a physician. Next day I
received a note from him declining the proposed consultation, as
his wife had perfect confidence in me. On Saturday I received a
message that she was worse, and that I was to bring Dr. Hobson
with me. Dove came afterwards to my house, and said he thought
she would not recover, and that he should object to a <i>post mortem</i>
examination. I said I thought there would be no need of one, and
that she would recover. He said his wife objected to it strongly.
He seemed excited, as with drink, but quite rational. We were
too late to see Mrs. Dove alive. From what Mr. Scarth told me I
took measures for a <i>post mortem</i> examination.</p>

<p>“I now attribute the symptoms I have heard described to the
poison of strychnia&mdash;from the symptoms and what I found in the
body&mdash;finding in the body no organic disease to account for
death. <i>The symptoms do not correspond with those of any other
disease, but do with those produced by strychnia.</i> In hysteria the
symptoms are more irregular; they do not assume a tetanic
character; there is more disturbance of the mind; and such
attacks are never fatal. Tetanic affections are stiffening of the
limbs, rigidity, and stretching out of the limbs, arching back of
the trunk, stiffening of the neck and jaw. The symptoms of
hysteria might be some of those symptoms. No one but might be
found in hysteria, but not all together. The symptoms are
separately and conjointly in accordance with poisoning by strychnia.
On Monday, March 3rd, <i>forty-two</i> hours after death, by
authority of the prisoner’s mother, I made a <i>post mortem</i> examination
in conjunction with Mr. Nunneley, and drew up the following
joint report.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">It is unnecessary to give in detail the first portion of this
report, in which, from a most careful examination of all parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of the body, it was evident that the death could not be attributed
to any known organic disease. With the exception of a
slight appearance of congestion in the intestines, every part
of the body was in a healthy state, and the stomach contained
only usual food. The report then continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“No appearance of irritation from any mineral or other
irritant poison, nor any odour of any poison recognizable by
smell. Hence we searched for strychnia. We divided the stomach
and its contents into three parts:&mdash;(1.) The brown pulpy mass
in the stomach; (2.) The mucous and all other matters that
could be removed from the stomach; (3.) The stomach itself.
By the usual tests we obtained strychnia from each of these.
The spirituous extracts were also unusually bitter. In the contents
of the intestines we found only faint traces. We obtained the
body of the cat, that had been poisoned some time before, and
proved that it is possible to discover strychnia in a dead body
some time after death. The result was decidedly the same
evidence as we had from the human body.”</p>

<p class="p1">The report then gave the details of the processes by which
the strychnia had been detected. (1.) Taste; (2.) Nitric
acid, producing a red colour (<i>the test for brucia</i>); (3.) Acetic
acid and solution of chloride of gold, producing a yellowish-white
precipitate (<i>of doubtful value</i>); (4.) Concentrated sulphuric
acid and solution of bichromate of potash, both in
powder and in solution, producing the purple colour; (5.)
The application of the same tests to strychnia itself with
the same results, by each of them separately, and repeated
with such variations as could detect any error that might have
crept in, and the conclusion to which the analysts came that
the stomach contained strychnia enough to cause death.</p>

<p>The report then described the effects of administering
portions of the spirituous extracts proved to have contained
strychnia to several animals, five in number. In the cases of
four of these, two rabbits, one mouse, and a guinea-pig, the
liquid was given by inoculation through small openings
either in the cellular tissues beneath the skin, or into one of
the mucous cavities of the body; and in the case of one of
the mice, by the mouth. In three cases death followed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the respective intervals of two, twelve, and fifty minutes after
the introduction of the poison; and in one case&mdash;that of a
rabbit&mdash;although for a time it remained nearly dead, it afterwards
revived, and eventually recovered. In the case of the
pig, the effects were much more slight; the spasms were not
so violent as to throw it down and entirely disable it, but on
the following day it was found dead, with the muscles rigid,
and the hind legs extended, as if from poison. “<i>The symptoms
preceding death, in all the cases, were, disturbed respiration,
general distress, convulsive twitchings and jerkings, tetanic
spasms, a peculiar out-stretching of the legs, and general
rigidity, exactly those commonly produced by strychnia.</i>”
The same effects, for the sake of comparison, were produced
in a parallel series of experiments on animals with ordinary
strychnia, which, as a series, were not more severe, or more
rapidly fatal. “These experiments,” said the analysts,
“which add the test of physiological effect to that of the
chemical reagent, directly confirm our analysis, and taking
them in connection with the analyses and with the symptoms
observed during life, and with the appearances noted after
death, they afford, in our opinion, the most complete proof
that the death of Mrs. Dove was from the poisonous effects
of strychnia, and from no other cause.”</p>

<p>The witness then spoke from his own personal knowledge
of cases of poisoning by strychnia, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I cannot refer the death to any other cause, nor the symptoms
during life, as described by the witnesses Witham, Fisher, and Wood.
<i>There is no other substance that will produce such symptoms and
appearances.</i> I tried similar experiments on a little dog, with the
same results. <i>Strychnia is not a cumulative poison. The effect of
of it passes off entirely by a gradual subsidence of the spasms. In
part the strychnia is absorbed in the blood, in part it passes off by the
secretions, part remains in the stomach, its carbon, hydrogen, and
other constituents broken up. If not decomposed, it would act on
other animals.</i> The series of symptoms produced by strychnia
were complete. I have no doubt that each of the several attacks
were produced by strychnia. Several of the medicines I sent to
Mrs. Dove were bitter, containing aloes and gentian, and hot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
containing ammonia and ether. <i>The effects of strychnia would
follow from in a few seconds to an hour and a half, depending on
the constitution of the person, and state of the stomach, and how the
strychnia was administered.</i> Assuming that Mrs. Dove took no food
or tea, I should refer the time at which she took the strychnia to
the time at which she took the medicine. That would be the
natural time for the attack; she would be attacked in a quarter
to half an hour after taking it. The strychnia I had in my
surgery was a soft white powder, fine, but not so fine as salt.
There is a form of pure crystallised strychnia more like salt.
I should judge that she had taken two to three grains to produce
the results of Saturday night. You might take two or three
grains between your finger and thumb: a quarter of a grain
would kill a dog. I have examined one of the bottles of medicine
which I sent to Mrs. Dove; it is the same as I sent.”</p>

<p class="p1">The witness also related the following conversations with
the prisoner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“During the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, I had a conversation with
the prisoner at his mother’s. He asked me what we had found
in the analysis&mdash;had we found poison? I said the analysis was
not complete, and could not give any answer till it was. I said
we had not found any natural causes of death. He asked me, ‘If
poison was found, what would the jury say? ‘ I replied, that
‘They could only say it was taken by accident, or intentionally,
or given to her by some one.’ He wished me to let him know
before the inquest if we had found poison. I had inquired about
his getting poison, and asked him how often. He replied, ‘Only
once, and that he had it to kill mice, as well as cats; had placed
it in his razor-case, and told his wife that it was the poison
Palmer used; that it was a deadly poison, and she must not
touch it.’ I never told him there should be no examination.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> by Mr. Bliss, after speaking to his
having attended the Dove family for many years, but seen
but little of the prisoner before he came to Leeds, the witness
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“When the conversation about strychnia took place, the prisoner
asked me if I suspected him, and said, ‘Should I have done it
openly if I had intended to do it? Should I have come to your
surgery for it or have talked openly about it to other people?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Could I have been so cruel?’ That was the first time that I
named strychnia to any relative. I examined the little dog and
have no doubt it died of strychnia. They brought me a piece of
carpet and the board on which was blood, but I discovered no
strychnia. I could not; the quantity was too small. I think the
stains in the carpet and on the board could not have contained
strychnia enough to have poisoned the dog. I discovered very
little blood in the intestines. Strychnia is exceedingly bitter.
One part in 40,000 would be bitter, less would be perceptibly
bitter. There was a considerable quantity of fæces in the intestines,
and three or four ounces of digested food. Mrs. Dove’s
medicines were alkaline. I saw Mrs. Dove every day from Monday
to Saturday, and she told me her ailments. I found nothing in
the body to account for death but the strychnia taken on Saturday.
Strychnia is not soluble in alkali. The symptoms I have heard
to-day, prior to those on Saturday, are additional to what I saw.
Hysteria would have left no symptoms. There was nothing inconsistent
with strychnia having been administered before in the
appearances of the body. The engorged state of the lungs and the
condition of the brain favoured that view. <i>I say this guardedly.</i>
She might with this condition of body have been better on Saturday,
as congestion would pass away quickly. I found no symptoms
on Saturday of the brain or lungs being engorged. She was better
in health, in spirits, and in appetite. Mrs. Witham’s and Mrs.
Fisher’s statements have changed my opinion. The symptoms
they describe are all to be found separately in hysteria. Mr.
Scarth’s account also influenced me, which I did not hear until
after her death. It was my opinion at the time that she was
affected with hysteria. <i>In a paroxysm from strychnia it is possible
that a patient might wish to be rubbed, but it is not what I should
‘à priori,’ look for. Touch sometimes renews the spasms, but it
depends upon the stage. The desire not to be touched is a symptom of
strychnia.</i> After hearing of her symptoms I prescribed a liniment
to be rubbed. <i>It consisted with the dose of strychnia said to have
been administered that she should be better on Saturday.</i> The effect
of hysteria would be to gorge the vessels of the brain and lungs.
<i>Not shrinking from touch was consistent with strychnia, but a desire
not to be touched was an indication of it.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i>, the witness said&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<i>There are several cases in which persons labouring under strychnia
had desired to be rubbed.</i> Parts of the body might fall on the floor
as well as the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>By a Juror.</i>&mdash;If strychnia were put in the medicine it would not
alter the colour of it, it might have left a powdery deposit. I never
knew a case of hysteria cause death with such external appearances
as in Mrs. Dove’s case.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Thomas Nunneley</i>, professor of surgery in the Leeds
College of Medicine, who was examined in Palmer’s case on
behalf of that prisoner, and then maintained that if Cook had
been poisoned by strychnia it would have been found in his
body by the chemical and other tests as late as the sixth day
after his death, confirmed the statements in the joint report,
and the opinion of Mr. Morley, that Mrs. Dove had died from
the effects of strychnia. His experiments on strychnia in the
cases of animals had been carried on for over thirty years,
and he was of opinion that, “though he should not have
anticipated the improvement spoken of on the Saturday, yet
that it was not inconsistent with her having taken strychnia
on the Friday.” On <i>cross-examination</i> by Mr. Bliss, he gave
the following evidence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I found nothing on dissection that could not be referred to the
strychnia taken on the Saturday night&mdash;the intensity of that
attack might have produced the appearances in the brain and
lungs. Hysteria will simulate the appearances of other diseases,
and among them of tetanus. I did not examine the fæces and
tissues of the body, but I should expect to find strychnia in the
tissues if taken six days before. My attention was not called to
its having been taken before Saturday, but even if it had
I think I should have found it. This case and the one in London
(Palmer’s) have advanced our knowledge in the discovery of this
poison far beyond what it was before. <i>It accords with my experience
that a person suffering from strychnia would not bear to be rubbed.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i>&mdash;“I attribute the symptoms exhibited before
Saturday to strychnia. They are not so in accordance with any
disease as with strychnia.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Christison</i>, the eminent writer on poisons, also agreed
with Mr. Morley and Mr. Nunneley as to the cause of the
symptoms. He admitted that “it was just possible to attribute
them to hysteria, but had never seen such a combination
of symptoms in an hysteric case. He thought it was unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
for a person to be insensible before death in a case of
strychnia, but he had seen it lately in the case of an animal
killed by that poison&mdash;the symptoms were exactly those
which would be produced by an overdose of strychnia in the
prior attacks.”</p>

<p><i>Dr. Hobson</i>, who had seen the deceased with Mr. Morley a
few minutes after her death, “saw nothing either in her
countenance or position that he thought particular, and
admitted that all the symptoms described before those of
Saturday might be accounted for in an aggravated form of
hysteria, but would not expect a person who suffered under
such a form of hysteria to be conscious, nor did he attribute
these symptoms to that disease.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Teal</i>, who had been in practice in Leeds for thirty-four
years, agreed “in the symptoms being entirely in
accord with strychnia, and though he had seen hysteria
simulate strychnism, he had never seen it entirely resemble
the entire group of symptoms represented in this case; had
he heard only of the symptoms before Saturday, he should
have considered them in strict accordance with the effects of
that poison; and even if he had heard of hysteric symptoms
before, he should have suspected strychnia, but would not
deny the possibility of their being consistent with hysteria.”
In reply to a juryman, he added the following evidence on
the probable reason for the state of the prisoner’s mind:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Excessive drinking without producing <i>delirium tremens</i> might
cause the conduct of the prisoner, described by Harrison,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> as to
spirits and noises. He might have any delusions when under the
influence of drink, but when sober such a man might be sound in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
mind and without delusions, and when partially drunk might have
delusions without suffering under <i>delirium tremens</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Richard Hey</i>, who had been in practice in York for
twenty-seven years, and concurred with the other medical
men, on <i>cross-examination</i>, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have had experience in hysteria, and have seen cases in which
many of the symptoms would be the same as those described. The
freedom from affection of the brain would lead me to suspect it to
be strychnia. I think the violent twitchings and spasms, and the
extreme pain they produced, would make a very marked distinction
from the effects of hysteria. I have never seen instances of screaming
out from pain in hysteria. I have heard of screaming out. They
complain of pain, but not violent pain. <i>The spasm consequent on
strychnia would, I imagine, induce a patient to be rubbed as in ordinary
spasms and cramp, but I never saw spasms so intense as in
those spoken of in strychnia. One of the most marked symptoms in
strychnia, in aggravated cases, is not being able to bear to be touched,
but it is not so in slight attacks.</i>” <i>Re-examined.</i>&mdash;“I never knew
touching or walking across a room not bearable in hysteria, or pain
in the jaws, or all these things combined in hysteria.”</p>

<p class="p1">The last witness called by the prosecution, <i>Mr. William
Hey</i>, who had been in practice in Leeds for thirty-seven
years, was equally of opinion that the symptoms were inconsistent
with any known disease, but consistent with the effects
of strychnia, and with nothing else. “Had he heard only
the evidence of the symptoms down to Friday night, her
hysterical temperament, and her recovery on the Saturday,
he should not have attributed them to hysteria, but he should
have thought it a most extraordinary case.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE PRISONER’S ACTIONS AND STATEMENTS.</p>

<p>In addition to the acts and statements of the prisoner reported
in the “Early Life of the Prisoner” and the evidence
already given, <i>Miss Fisher</i> deposed to his very violent threats
against his wife, especially when in liquor; his telling her on
one occasion “to mind her own business, or he would do her
job for her”; his threatening her with a knife and striking
her, and telling her “he would give her a pill”; and to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
wife saying, in his presence, “If I should die, it is my wish,
Elizabeth, that you should tell my friends to have my body
examined”; to his writing a letter to the witchman Harrison,
asking him “to torment his wife when at Manchester, as
she was not a right woman”; and telling the witness that
Harrison had told him that his wife’s days would end in
February. He also told another witness (<i>Elizabeth Thornhill</i>,
a charwoman) that Harrison had told him that his wife would
not live long, and that he would marry the lady next door
(Mrs. Witham).</p>

<p>Whilst the inquest was proceeding he asked Mrs. Witham
how it was going on, and when she said to him, “It is a very
suspicious thing that you gave her the medicine at eight
o’clock and that she became ill a quarter of an hour after,”
he replied, “If they ask me if I gave the medicine, I shall
say I did not; and if they ask if she took it herself, I shall
say I do not know.”</p>

<p>To <i>Margaret Gray</i>, another witness, he stated on the
Friday that his wife was ill of spasms, and he did not think
she would live over Saturday night.</p>

<p>To <i>Mary Hicks</i> he more than once stated that he was sure
his wife would die, and that Mr. Morley would want a <i>post
mortem</i> examination, as he did in his father’s case, but that
he would object to it, as he had promised his wife to do; that
he should probably soon marry again; and when Mrs. Hicks
told him to go back, as his wife might have another attack, he
said she would not until half-past ten or eleven, and made no
reply when again asked if the attacks were periodical.
On the Sunday morning after his wife’s death, he told this
witness that there was to be an inquest, and when she asked
why, said, “Oh, we live in a bad neighbourhood, and have
not lived happily together. It is all nonsense.” To the Rev.
H. T. Sturgeon, the clergyman of Burley, whom he asked to
visit his wife, and to whom he professed to be very anxious
about her spiritual welfare, he assigned as his reason for not
calling in further advice (as recommended by Mr. Morley) his
fear of offending that gentleman. To a man of the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
<i>Rose</i>, a baker, whose name even he did not know, and whom
he met by accident in a dram shop on the Thursday before his
wife’s death, he said that he thought his wife would die, and
told him “not to come to him till he saw her death in the
paper, and then, if he lighted on a woman that would suit
him, to bring her down to his house, as he could not do
without one if his wife died.”</p>

<p>To <i>Harrison</i>, the watchman, on the Thursday after his
wife’s death, when giving him a card for her funeral, he said
there was an inquest on her. When Harrison asked why, the
prisoner said, “Can they detect a grain or a grain and a half
of strychnia?” “Why,” replied Harrison, “have you given
her any?” “No,” replied Dove; “but I got some of
Morley’s man to kill cats, and some might have been spilt and
she have got it.” Again Harrison saw him the next day,
when he said, “Mr. Morley has told me they have found
poison in my wife. Could they take me if I go back?” “I
should,” replied Harrison. “If you are innocent, go back;
what occasion have you to be frightened? They will not take
you if you are innocent,” and Dove then went away.</p>

<p>To his wife’s mother, <i>Mrs. Jenkins</i>, who came to his house
after her daughter’s death, he said at breakfast on the Friday,
the day of the adjourned inquest, “Do you know that a
sprinkle of oil of almonds will kill a person? Arsenic you
can detect in a body after 20 years. Belladonna you cannot;
one is a mineral, the other a vegetable. There is a poison
like this”&mdash;taking up a piece of salt&mdash;“in a man you can
detect it, in a woman you cannot.” He told her also that he
could not think but that he should marry again. When he
talked about the poisons another person, a <i>Mrs. Risdon</i>, was
present.</p>

<p>To <i>Mr. Scarth</i>, a pupil of Mr. Morley’s, who, in consequence
of the latter’s engagement, was the first to see her on
the 25th of February, he put the question whether Mr.
Morley would require a <i>post mortem</i> examination if his wife
died. Scarth replied that Mr. Morley generally did on all his
patients who died suddenly, when the prisoner said, “I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
not consent.” “Probably,” said Scarth, “as you did when
your father died.” “His wife,” replied Dove, “would not
consent.”</p>

<p>On the close of the case for the prosecution, Mr. Bliss
called on the counsel to put into the box the remainder of the
witnesses whose names were on the back of the bill, and Mr.
Hardy, in the absence of his leader, declining to take this
responsibility, Baron Bramwell, on the authority of the case
of <i>R.</i> v. <i>Woodhead</i>, ruled that the prosecutor need not do so,
but was bound to have the witnesses in Court so that they
might, if required, be called by the defence.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p class="psh">THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>Though the defence of the prisoner was mainly rested on
the question of his sanity, Mr. Bliss urged on the jury that
the circumstantial evidence against him was inconclusive,
turning the openness of the prisoner’s acts and conversations,
and his attention to his wife during her attacks, to the best
advantage. On the question of his sanity, in addition to the
mischievous and cruel acts that had been elicited in cross-examination,
he cited as further proof his belief in witchcraft
and his frequent consultations with the witchman Harrison,
and his request to that person to torment his wife, professedly
to force her to return to his bed. The witchman, said counsel,
not contemplating the murderous result, encouraged him, and
held out such promises of future happiness that the desire
ripened into practice, and the wife was murdered. Even after
detection was inevitable, the confidence of the dupe remained
unimpaired, and he firmly believed that the witchman could
rescue him from his doom. As a proof of this insane belief
the following letter written in his own blood, which had been
found in his pocket when in jail, was read:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

I remain, your faithful subject,</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">William Dove</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>In support of the plea of insanity, in addition to the witnesses
already referred to in the introduction to this case, three
medical witnesses of tried experience in lunacy, <i>Dr. Caleb
Williams</i> (for 30 years the medical attendant at the York
Asylum), <i>Dr. Pyeman Smith</i> (of the Leeds Lunatic Asylum),
and <i>Mr. John Kitchen</i> (of The Retreat, at York), were called
for the defence, whose evidence, it is only fair, should be given
in some detail.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Williams</i>, who had been in Court during the whole
trial, and had also examined the prisoner with <i>Mr. Kitchen</i> a
few days before the trial, was decidedly of opinion, from the
evidence he had heard, that the prisoner was of unsound
mind, and that his violent emotions and his belief in supernatural
agency were indications of it.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Taking into account,” said the witness, “that he had written
and said similar things before about selling his soul to the devil, I
think that his letter to the devil was not simulated. It appears
to be written with blood. I had conversation with him about that
letter when I saw him, and he told me it was written under
satanic influence. The result of that conversation was that, in my
opinion, it was not simulated. I have no doubt that his illusion,
that he had sold himself to the devil, was a real one. I believe
his incantations spoken of were connected with his belief in supernatural
agency; and I think his saying that he had put a spell on
the steward arose from the same belief.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The letter to his schoolmaster,
in which he declared his sanity, is very like what is done
by insane persons&mdash;they declare they are sane. His talking to
various persons about strychnia showed the weakness of his mind.
The effect of drink on a lunatic are to make him violent and
dangerous. Persons liable to insanity would exhibit a tendency
and inclination to drink. <i>I think from what I have heard he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
not the power of controlling his emotions and passions. None of them
at all times.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> There would be periods when he would have control
over some.</i> The circumstance of his shooting the cat showed an
uncontrollable impulse to injure or take life; and seeing it was not
expended in injuring the man, he shot the cat. The effect of confining
a person for several weeks on strictly sober diet, who has
before been subject to get drunk, would be to reduce him to a calm
condition. The Castle diet is sober (Dove’s prison). <i>From all
I have heard and seen, I consider his powers of mind, during the
fatal week were probably influenced by his notions regarding supernatural
agency, and that consequently he was the subject of a delusion.
During that week, labouring under such delusions, he might retain his
power of adapting means to an end, and of judging of the consequences.
He could not under those delusions have the power of resisting any
impulse.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>On cross-examination</i> by Mr. Overend, after repudiating the
notion that his evidence was tinged by religious objections to
capital punishment, the witness said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I should not call administering poison five or six times an
<i>impulse</i>, but a <i>propensity</i>&mdash;an uncontrollable <i>propensity</i> to destroy
life, and give pain. For the time it would be a permanent condition
of the mind, and might select the special object, and
constantly seek opportunities of carrying out the <i>propensity</i>. <i>I
think a person with such a propensity would not know that he was
doing wrong. I think he might fear the consequences, and know that
punishment would follow. He would know, probably, that he was
breaking the law. I say that, because he would have a very incorrect
appreciation of right and wrong. He would not know at the time
that he would be hanged. I found that opinion on the occupation
of the mind by the insane propensity. It is uncertain whether he
would know it before he did it. He might after he had done it.</i>
He might do a murder secretly, because he could not otherwise
do it. A <i>propensity</i> of that kind generally acts without a motive.
One of the peculiarities is that a person seeks no escape: in
certain cases acknowledges his crime. The <i>propensity may come
on suddenly: an impulse comes on suddenly&mdash;a propensity more
frequently comes on slowly, and starts from a considerable time</i>.
If a man gives way to his passions, and commits a rape, I call
that a <i>vice</i>, and not a <i>propensity</i>. Supposing a cruel man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wishes to get rid of his wife, quarrels with her, in the abstract
that is a <i>vice</i>. Supposing a man to have taken every precaution
against discovery, and pains to procure poison for his wife, and
to prepare for her death, I should think that a <i>vice</i>, and not a
<i>delusion</i>. Supposing a man of cruel disposition had formed a
dislike to his wife, and wanted to get rid of her, and had nursed
that dislike into a <i>propensity</i> to kill. I should call that <i>an insane
propensity</i>. I don’t say that every man who dislikes his wife,
and wishes to get rid of her, is insane. When he acquires the
propensity to kill, and cannot control it, he is insane.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“If a person lived with his wife, hated her, and
determined to, and did kill her, what is the difference between
that determination which is <i>vice</i>, and that <i>propensity</i> which is
<i>insanity</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The prisoner’s history would be required to determine
whether it was <i>vice</i> or <i>insanity</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing a man was determined to kill his wife,
and he nurses the thought for six months, till the desire becomes
uncontrollable, when does the desire become insanity?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“When by nourishing such an idea, the mind becomes
diseased, and he cannot control his acts&mdash;that applies to other
things.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“If a man dwells on the possession of a woman till
he cannot control his desire, would that be <i>vice</i> or <i>insanity</i>?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It might be insanity, and might apply to rape.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
In insanity there is a tendency to thieve. Theft is one of the
indications of moral insanity; and a man may desire to possess
another man’s goods, till he cannot control his acts. He is then
insane. If a man permits himself to indulge a passion till he
becomes uncontrollable, that is <i>moral insanity</i>, and he is not
responsible. Consulting a sorcerer, and all superstitious beliefs,
are indications of a weak mind. Belief in clairvoyance and dreams
is not necessarily an indication of insanity. A belief in spiritual
rappings, I should infer, was an indication of a weak mind.
Talking to persons about strychnia, and his wife’s death, I think
indicated a feeble state of mind.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i>, <i>Dr. Williams</i> said&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Imitativeness is one of the characteristics of insanity, and
hearing strychnia and Palmer’s trial very much talked about would
be very likely, in a weak mind, to produce imitation. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
know a man’s history before you can say whether his acts proceed
from vice or insanity. Madness very frequently developes itself
in great cunning and foresightedness when reasoning on false
premises. I have frequently known insane persons to attempt to
escape from the asylum, and to have shown great cleverness in
their preparations for it extending over several days.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Suppose you had heard the case of a man put to
you who wished to get rid of his wife, and had from his childhood
displayed cruelty of disposition&mdash;had threatened to shoot his father;
said he heard supernatural noises, sometimes treated his wife kindly,
and sometimes cried like no other man, would you have any doubt
that he was insane?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No! and not fit to be at large. I should have no
difficulty, as a medical man, in certifying that he was a lunatic.
Lunatics have often displayed great ingenuity in committing theft
and concealing it. The passion of lust frequently becomes a disease
of the mind. When the prisoner gave his cows linseed to take one
night, to fatten them for market the next morning, that I should
deem an indication of an unsound mind.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>In reply to questions by the Judge</i>, the witness said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>”It would require a longer period than a month to establish disease
and an uncontrollable propensity to commit a crime. If a man committed
a crime, having thought of it for a month, I should not say he
was of unsound mind. The difference would depend on length of
time. Some men’s minds, previously weak, would take a shorter time,
and very exciting causes would shorten the time; but there must be an
appreciable period, and an interval for the mind to pass into a morbid
condition from the continual contemplation of one object.</i> The period
is necessarily very uncertain, from the variable effect of emotions
and circumstances on the mind.”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“Suppose, at the time when he shot the cat, a
policeman had come in, would he have shot it?”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. The presence of the policeman would probably
have controlled him; he would probably have expended the impulse
on some person or something else. Unless the person is
exceedingly violent, the presence of a policeman would have some
influence to control him.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“<i>Whenever a man commits a crime, is it because he is
uncontrolled by existing circumstances?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“<i>It is.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“<i>Then what is the difference between such a man and
the case you put?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“<i>In the case I put the impulse is uncontrollable, because
his mind would be so occupied with his purpose.</i>”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“Is it true of everybody, whether sane or insane,
that when intent on an act they forget the consequences?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“An insane man would be more likely to forget consequences.
Sane and insane persons would talk about occurrences.
How and what they talked about would depend on their judgment.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The witness wished to say with regard to the question
as to shooting the cat, that he thought the impulse of destruction
was so strong at the time, that he could not control it,
and must have shot something.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><i>Dr. Pyeman Smith</i>, the proprietor of a private lunatic
asylum at Leeds for the past 15 years, though, from what he
had heard and seen, he was prepared to declare that Dove was
of unsound mind during the fatal week, and had been so for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the last 20 years, admitted, on <i>cross-examination</i>, that he did
know right from wrong during that period. He, however, <i>on
re-examination</i>, qualified this admission.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“A decided lunatic,” said the witness, “very often knows right
from wrong, and yet may be regardless of any consequences from
his acts. <i>He may be utterly unable to refrain from doing an act,
though he knew it was wrong. I cannot say the prisoner was utterly
unable to refrain from wrong during the fatal week. Circumstances
might enable him to refrain&mdash;other circumstances.</i>”</p>

<p><i>To the Judge.</i>&mdash;“Not a greater degree of punishment. I have
already said he was entirely regardless of circumstances.”</p></div>

have prevented him.</i> I believe, during the week, it was from unsoundness
of mind that he was regardless of consequences.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. John Kitchen</i>, superintendent of The Retreat at York,
where the patients averaged a hundred, also agreed with the
previous medical witnesses, that Dove was of unsound mind
during the fatal week. He, however, admitted that “<i>during
that period he knew right from wrong, had some knowledge of
the difference&mdash;some knowledge that he was committing murder&mdash;and
that if found out he would be punished</i>.” This admission
he sought to explain away, <i>on re-examination</i>, protesting
that what he meant was “that Dove knew he was killing his
wife, but did not know he was doing a wrong act&mdash;that he
would know in proportion as he knew the difference between
right and wrong.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Question by a juryman.</i>&mdash;“Do you adopt the theory of Dr.
Smith as to irresistible propensity in mania?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“In general terms I do.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you adopt it in this case?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not. I account for the murder, if he committed
it, on different principles. We have a man of deficient
mental powers; besides that he is insane; he is liable to do any
absurd, cruel, or vicious or irrational action that presented itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to his mind, as his life shows. Supposing him to be insane, I
should apply the term <i>vicious</i> or <i>malignant</i> to him. We have
heard, in evidence, that he was brought up by pious parents, put
to the best schools, and was unable to receive the smallest
amount of education. We see him carried away to do the most
foolish things. Where he loves, he loves with a foolish intensity;
and where he hates, he hates with a foolish malignity: and if a
woman puts herself into the power of such a man as his wife,
what has happened is just what might have been expected.”</p>

<p><i>To Mr. Overend.</i>&mdash;“<i>I think he knew right from wrong&mdash;that it
was wrong to steal or murder.</i> If he murdered, I should expect him
to deny it in that form of insanity. In one form of insanity, impulsive
madness, they own their crime. This case was only partly
impulsive, and I should not expect him to divulge it. If he
thought of this crime before he committed it, he would know it
was wrong. He probably would learn it was wrong in his childhood.
It is impossible to say when he committed the act he knew
it was wrong. I don’t know when he would know it was wrong. I
can give no opinion about it.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>On re-examination</i>, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“There are dangerous wards in some asylums, but I should not
expect to find the greatest number of impulsive cases in that
ward. Sometimes impulsive lunatics are dangerous. The keepers
have an influence over them&mdash;a mental influence. They formerly
worked on their fears, and thus kept patients under control.
There is a madness which consists in a <i>propensity</i> to kill. If a
stranger was left with such a one in a room alone, I should
expect him to exercise his <i>propensity</i> and kill him; and yet,
probably, that patient would yield his keeper obedience. Probably
the fear of some chastisement would induce fear of his
keeper.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p>The greater portion of Baron Bramwell’s charge was necessarily
occupied by reading over and commenting on the
evidence produced by the prosecution&mdash;that the death of the
wife had been due to the administration of strychnia, and
that the prisoner had opportunities of administering it. The
evidence on these points has been already so fully reported
that it is needless to give this portion of his exhaustive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
summing-up. His remarks on the rule of law on the plea of
insanity, and on the nature of the insanity suggested by the
medical witnesses, are too valuable to be omitted.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The rules of law,” said the learned Baron, “are that it must
be clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act, the
party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from
disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the
act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he
was doing wrong. If the accused was conscious of the act he did,
he is punishable; and what you have to consider is, had he sufficient
degree of sanity to know he was doing wrong? With
respect to delusions the law is the same. According to the law, as
I lay it down to you on the highest authority, to exempt a man
from the penal consequence of his act, the act being contrary to
the law, you must be of opinion that at the time he did the act he
was not conscious that it was one he ought not to do; for if he
was conscious that it was contrary to law, he is punishable. You
must be satisfied that he had not a sufficient degree of reason to
know that he was doing an act that was wrong&mdash;of course that
means an act prohibited by law: because a man might imagine
that the thing was a right thing to do, and it might not be contrary
to law. He might think it right to take from the rich and
give to the poor. But if he did it, not knowing it was wrong, he
must not know that the thing which he did was what the law
would punish him for. It is not necessary for me to justify the
law, or for you to approve it. We have only to administer it.
Don’t, however, suppose for a moment that I doubt the reasonableness
of it.</p>

<p>“Let me put a case to you. A man labours under a delusion.
He thinks I have done him wrong&mdash;have traduced his character.
He waylays and murders me. Why should he be acquitted? Suppose
he was wronged, that would not justify his taking away my
life. Suppose, again, a person imagined some part of his person to
be made of glass, or had swallowed something, or got something
wrong in his inside. Imagine that man deliberately waylaying a
person, knowing that he possessed property, to take it from him,
and afterwards to conceal what he had done, and to act in every
other respect as a rational man. Why should he be held irresponsible
for this because he was irrational in other respects?</p>

<p>“Why should punishment be administered at all? It was not
inflicted on a man who had committed a crime because he had
inflicted that upon others, but in order to hold out an example to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
deter other people. If you punish an insane man, you hold out
no example, because you are punishing a man who thinks he is
doing right. But take the case of a man who is labouring under a
delusion&mdash;under an evil propensity. If you punish him when he
does wrong, or any other person with a similar propensity to commit
that offence, and he knows, that when he indulged in it, or
that when somebody else did, he was punished for it, that will
deter him from repeating or from doing that act. Take the case
of a man who has a strong propensity to thieve&mdash;a strong desire
on him to do it; his intellect not very strong, and he knows that
he is punished if he does such an act: do not you think, if he is
punished, it will deter him from doing it again? There cannot be
a doubt that it is so; and if you were to announce to all the
world, that a man who has a strong propensity to an evil, that a
person in his condition, shall not be punished, you take away from
such persons the only thing that would deter them from committing
the evil. Take a man of a weak mind and strong animal
propensities, and it will not deter him from committing such an
act.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Again, after going carefully through the evidence in the
case, and pointing out the application of the different classes
of proofs, the learned Baron said that “he thought none of
the instances of strange conduct adduced when the prisoner
was a boy evidence of insanity more than might be found in
the conduct of a perverse, ill-conducted boy;” and contrasted
the opinions of the witnesses as to his being almost an idiot
with the letters written by him, which exhibited no traces
of mental incapacity.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In commenting on the opinions of
the medical men of experience in insanity, he adopted the
judgment of Dr. Lushington in the Dyce Sombre case, “that
the facts to which they depose, and not their opinions alone,
were of weight;” and added “that he sincerely believed
that the jury were as capable of judging as these mad
doctors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Two of them,” continued the learned judge, “were of opinion
that the contemplation of a crime constituted insanity, if it were
only contemplated enough. Then it was said that a man who had
a propensity to vice, to cruelty, to crime, was insane. Take the
case of a man found guilty at these assizes of a crime. It is found
that he has twice been convicted before and in prison half a dozen
times, and that he has a general propensity to commit crime. In
such a case, why should not Dr. Williams come forward and say,
“You are wrong. He is insane; you ought not to punish him.”
If they believed these experts you would take away protection
from the community, because they would have a check less to
prevent the commission of crime. It would be affectation in him
to say that he did not set a value on this scientific evidence. But
he would rather take his own independent opinion, than that of
others, on the facts. But it was not for him to do more than
comment, and for the jury to judge of its value&mdash;of the conduct
of the prisoner, of his letters, and of the arguments before them.”</p>

<p class="p1">After a brief consideration the jury returned a verdict of
“guilty, but recommended him to mercy on the ground of his
defective intellect.” Sentence of death was passed on him,
and he was executed at York.</p>

<p class="psh">THE PRISONER’S CONFESSIONS.</p>

<p>A day or two before his execution Dove dictated two long
and extraordinary statements of his connection with the
“Witchman,” and the part played in the tragedy by this
dangerous man, which contrast strongly with the evidence
given by Harrison himself, and probably disclose facts which
that person was glad to conceal at the time of his examination.</p>

<p>In the first of these statements he details his earlier interviews
with the “Witchman” on the subjects of recovering
lost cattle, removing strange noises from his house, and the
bewitching of his live stock, in which Harrison appears to have
played off on him the common tricks of his trade. His confidence
in this fellow was unfortunately largely increased by
his prophecying that Dove’s father would die before a certain
Christmas Day&mdash;he died on Christmas Eve&mdash;and led him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
consult the “Witchman” about his wife when he first conceived
his violent hatred towards her.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“About August, 1855,” he says, “I had some unpleasantness
with my wife, and went over to Harrison at Leeds, told him of it,
and he promised to make it all right. He told me I must let
him know by letter how things went on. In two days after this
I wrote him that my wife was no better, and that he must do
something to make peace. I sent this by Fisher, a porter at the
railway station, to post. Mrs. Dove knew I had written, but not
what about. She therefore sent the servant to Fisher, got back
the letter, took out what I had written, and put in a blank sheet.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
I did not know this at the time, but, hearing some whispering,
wrote another letter, and posted it myself about two o’clock. At
three I went myself to Harrison, who told me he had received
a blank sheet, and asked why, and I told him. I then informed
him of the unpleasantness and unhappiness with my wife, and he
said ‘You will never have happiness till she is out of the way.’
I said ‘How do you know that.’ He said ‘Come upstairs and I’ll
tell you, for I’ve got your nativity marked out.’ [Upstairs he
showed him a paper with the signs of the Zodiac, and hieroglyphical
forms and numbers, which he describes at length.]
Harrison then read out of a book my destiny. Between twenty-seven
and thirty-two all would go against me. I should have
nothing but misfortunes; that at thirty-two the sun and moon
would come into conjunction, and then everything would be in my
favour; that at thirty-two I should lose my wife, marry again, and
have a child, and an addition to my fortune; and that for my sake
he did not care how soon it was here, for until then I should never
be a happy man; that after ‘thirty-two’ everything would go
well for a few years. He made other remarks as to different
periods of my life.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then follow the usual enquiries about the kind of person
that was to be his second wife.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I saw Harrison again in November about my wife’s temper.
He said never mind, ‘she will die before the end of February or
March, I am not certain which.’ When he told me my wife would
die soon I said ‘You have told me before she would die at thirty-two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>’
He replied ‘Before thirty-two, but I did not say how much
before.’ In a few days afterwards (after December 21) I went to
the ‘New Cross Inn,’ and Harrison came in with a newspaper and
read about Palmer’s case. I then asked him whether strychnia
could be detected, and he said ‘No, nor any other vegetable
poison.’ I then said ‘What other vegetable poisons are there that
cannot be detected? and he said ‘Digitalis, belladonna, particularly
if crystallised; he could not remember more then.’ I then asked
him to get or make me some strychnia, as we were much annoyed
in our new house with cats, but he refused. I told him I would
get some elsewhere.</p>

<p>“I went to him again in January last about my wife. I told
him about my wife’s temper and her being poorly then, and he
again said, ‘She won’t live long; she will never get better. As I
told you before, she will die in February.’</p>

<p>“I had no further communication with Harrison until the 6th
of March, when I sent for him to the ‘New Cross Inn,’ and told
him my wife had died, and that an inquest was to be held. He
asked, ‘Why?’ I said, ‘My wife died very suddenly, and Mr.
Morley cannot account for it, and it is known that I had strychnia
in the house. Mr. Morley thinks some may have been spilt, and
my wife got at it accidentally.’ I then said, ‘You told me strychnia
could not be detected, but I have seen in the <i>Materia Medica</i> that
it can;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> what is your opinion now? Can a grain to a grain and a
half be detected, for there is a great difference on the subject?
Professor Taylor says it cannot be detected twenty-four hours
after death in the human body.’ Harrison said, ‘What, have you
poisoned your wife?’ I replied, ‘No, I should be very sorry to.’
Nothing more passed then.</p>

<p>“On Friday, the 7th, whilst the inquest was going on, I went
to the back door of Harrison’s house, about 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and said to him
‘that several witnesses had been called, and I was suspected of
poisoning my wife,’ and added, ‘How will the case go?’ He said,
‘It will be a very difficult case, but I can get you out.’ I said,
‘You only say you can; but tell me, will you?’ and he replied,
‘Set yourself altogether at rest; I will.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In the <i>second</i> statement he gives details of his administration
of the strychnia, declaring that even when he got the
second portion of that poison from Mr. Morley’s pupil he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
no intention of poisoning his wife, but only intended it
for the cats. His first attempt was with the jelly his sister
Jane had sent, of which, it may be remembered, the wife,
on the score of its bitterness, took only a spoonful. He then
goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the Saturday, after Fisher left,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I took the paper containing
the strychnia out of my razor-case and put it in my waistcoat-pocket,
and then went to my mother’s house. In the afternoon I
had previously called at Mr. Morley’s for my wife’s medicine. It
was an effervescing draught, in two bottles. At my mother’s that
evening I took the cork out of one of the bottles and touched the
wet end of it with the strychnia. On that Saturday evening my
wife took some of the draught in Mrs. Witham’s presence. Mrs.
Witham tasted it, and said it tasted bitter. The draught was not
shaken that night before taken. My wife did not suffer from the
effects at all. On my way from my mother’s that night I threw
away the remainder of the strychnia. I cannot tell you the
feelings of my mind when I put the strychnia into the jelly and
the mixture. I did not think at the moment as to its effects and
consequences. On the Sunday following, which was the 24th of
February, I went to the surgery; and there being no person there
at the time, I took perhaps ten grains of strychnia and folded them
in paper, and when I got home placed it in the stable. On the Monday
morning I gave my wife her medicine&mdash;the effervescent mixture&mdash;about
half-past nine, and at ten she had the attack mentioned by
Mrs. Fisher and Mrs. Witham. At the time she took it she complained
very much of the bitterness, and said she would tell Mr.
Morley about it. There were three or four doses left in the bottle
after that draught was taken, and I broke the bottle in my wife’s
presence, fearing Mr. Morley might taste it. The mixture was
changed on the Monday; the mixture then given was very bitter.
On Tuesday night or Wednesday morning I applied the wet end of
the cork of the medicine-bottle to the strychnia, as before. I think
there might be from half to a grain of strychnia on the cork when
I put it into the bottle. I shook the mixture up. There were
only two or three doses in the bottle. I don’t remember my wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
having an attack on the Wednesday. She took her medicine that
day. On Thursday I got another bottle of medicine from Mr.
Morley, and I again applied the wet end of the cork to the strychnia
as before. About the same quantity adhered. The last dose of
that medicine was taken on Friday night about ten, and my wife
was taken seriously ill in half an hour, but she had no arching of the
back, as far as I can remember. Mrs. Fisher is mistaken in that
point, but her statement in other respects is true, I believe. On
that Friday night I got another bottle of medicine from Mr. Morley’s,
directed to be taken four times a day. I did not put any strychnia
into that bottle, or upon its cork. Mrs. Witham gave a dose out
of that bottle in the afternoon of Saturday.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The strychnia was
in the stable, where I had first placed it, and there was none in the
razor-case on that day, nor during any part of that week. I was
drinking at Sadlefee’s public-house on that Saturday, and was more
or less affected with drink all that afternoon and evening. About
three in the afternoon I went to the stable and took a grain and a
half of strychnia out of the stable and put it in another paper,
which I placed in my waistcoat-pocket. I put that strychnia into
the wine-glass which contained a little water&mdash;I believe the water
left in the glass by Mrs. Witham after giving my wife the third
dose in the afternoon, but I have no recollection as to the time I
put the strychnia into the glass. I gave the mixture in the evening,
as stated by Mrs. Witham and Mrs. Wood in their evidence. I
poured the mixture into the glass which contained the water and
strychnia. I did not put the strychnia into the wine-glass in the
presence of Mrs. Witham and Mrs. Wood. I know that I put it
in before, but cannot tell how long before giving the medicine. I
did not, when I gave the medicine on the occasions mentioned,
think of the consequences; but when I saw my wife suffering on
the Saturday night, it flashed across my mind that I had given her
medicine, and that she would die from the effects. I was muddled
before this, and did not know what I was doing. When the
thoughts of her death crossed my mind, I regretted what I had
done, and believe that if Mr. Morley had come in at that moment
I should have told him what I had given her, so that he might
have used means to restore her. I cannot disguise the anguish I
felt when I returned from Mr. Morley’s and found her dead.
Palmer’s case first called my attention to strychnia, but I never
should have thought of using that or any other poison for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
purpose of taking my wife’s life but for Harrison, who was always
telling me that I should never have any happiness till my wife was
out of the way.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p class="pch">TRIAL OF SILAS BARLOW FOR THE WILFUL
MURDER OF ELIZA SOPER.</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Before</i> <span class="smcap">The Honorable Mr. Justice Denman</span>, <i>at the</i> <span class="smcap">Central Criminal
Court</span>, <i>November 27, 1876</i>.</p>

<p class="pc"><i>For the Prosecution</i>: Mr. Poland and Mr. Beasley.<br />
<i>For the Defence</i>: Mr. Fulton and Mr. Grubbe.</p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prisoner, an engine driver on the South-Western
Railway, about a year before the trial, on being left a widower,
had formed a connection with the deceased, who, with their
infant, came to lodge at the house of a Mrs. Wilson, in
Leopold Street, Vauxhall, in August, 1876, under the name
of Smith, where she was occasionally visited by the prisoner,
who passed as her husband. Apparently they lived together
on kindly terms, and were in fairly comfortable circumstances.
On the 3rd of September the prisoner visited her about half-past
eight in the evening, and stayed an hour. Up to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
day the deceased had been in good health. As soon, however,
as the prisoner had left, she came down from her room,
knocked at the landlady’s door, and complained to her that
she was very sick from the sarsaparilla which he had given
her. “Her lips were white, she was very nervous, and
appeared hardly able to stand,” said Mrs. Wilson. “I had
never seen her so before. She went upstairs, and when I
went to bed I went to her. She was retching very much, and
sitting in a chair. I then went away. Next morning I saw
her; she came downstairs and said she was very bad&mdash;worse.
She could not stand, and had to lean against the wall.
During the day she became better.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p>The prisoner came again on the Sunday following, the 10th,
at the same time as before.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The deceased,” said Mrs. Wilson, “was at the street door,
talking to me, with her baby, and in perfect health. They went
up into their room, and in about an hour the prisoner knocked
at my room door and said his wife had had two fits. I ran upstairs
and found her lying across the bed; the prisoner was in the room.
She was in a kind of fit or convulsion. I sent the prisoner for some
brandy and water. She became a little conscious, and taking me
by the hand said ‘<i>Don’t touch me</i>.’ She had been unconscious, <i>but
the moment she was touched she went into convulsions</i>. <i>Her feet and
hands were clenched, and she was drawn quite backwards, her back
forming an entire arch.</i> She was <i>not conscious</i> then. The prisoner
was holding her all the time. About half past ten I sent him for
Dr. Miller, who came at once, and applied mustard plasters,
remaining with her about five minutes, and the prisoner going
back with him for medicine. She was slightly conscious when
Dr. Miller came, and more so afterwards. Her feet were quite
<i>white(?)<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> the toes being drawn backwards to the soles of the feet</i>. I
did what the doctor told me, but it did not do her any good.
I tried to give her the medicine, but she could not take it, <i>and
went off in a swoon</i>. She had licked the spoon. She then had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
dreadful convulsions, one in particular, when it took the prisoner
and me to hold her. Her neck was drawn backwards and quite
arched. After that she became quite conscious, and said it was
the nasty sarsaparilla that made her ill. The prisoner said ‘Oh
no. I have taken more of it than you.’ He also said ‘I have
given her two pills and taken two myself.’ She complained of a
dreadful pain in her heart, <i>and continued unconscious, coming to
herself a little at times, but very slightly</i>. The convulsions were
dreadful, and she died about two o’clock on the eleventh. She
seemed to drop instantly after a dreadful convulsion. I gave her
two doses of the medicine the doctor sent. I had not seen any
sarsaparilla in the room.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>On cross-examination</i> by Mr. Fulton, after stating that she
had never heard any quarrels between the prisoner and the
deceased, she gave the following further particulars as to the
symptoms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the evening, when I was called in, her eyes were partly
closed during the convulsions; her breathing very hot (hard?) and
at most suspended; her teeth entirely clenched and also her hands
during the convulsions. She wanted to be sick shortly before her
death; her lips were pale, and remained so until her death. The
prisoner tried to move her, when she became sick, and she went
into convulsions. He helped to hold her, and said he could not
imagine what was the matter with her; seemed distressed, and sat
on the bed holding her. To all appearance he was kind to her
but not affectionate. <i>She was more unconscious than conscious
during the whole time.</i> About twelve o’clock she <i>appeared quite
conscious</i>. She had to move herself so that she could be sick,
and caught hold of the bed head, and then went again into convulsions.
<i>Virtually she was unconscious the whole time.</i> Dr. Miller
came a second time, and she told him she had had some fearful fits,
but I cannot recollect whether I said anything about the ‘arching.’
There was none when he saw her, but <i>her feet were curved</i>, and I
told him about the ‘shakings,’ I mean the ‘convulsions.’ I first
heard from the coroners officer that she had died of strychnia. I
had previously told him the symptoms attending her death, but
don’t remember telling him of the ‘arching.’ He said there was
every appearance of her having died from strychnia.”</p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>James Miller</i>, medical assistant at the Vauxhall dispensary,
before that with Mr. Scott, a general practitioner, and previously
an insurance agent, gave the following account of the
case:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“About twenty minutes to eleven on the 10th of September I
was called by the prisoner to his wife, who he said had had two
fainting fits. I found her lying on the bed, dressed, and quite
conscious. She lay very quietly. She said she had severe pain in
the legs, and that she had fainted twice. I asked her if she had
complained during the week. She said only of pains in the head.
I found the calves of her legs very rigid, her feet turned slightly
inwards, the toes of each foot inclined towards the other as she lay,
cramp in the lower limbs, her arms quiet. She beat her breast at
times. Her hands were partly closed, her heart very excited, and
her breathing slightly laboured. Her heart continued excited all
the time I was there, about five minutes. I asked her what she
had taken. She said a cup of tea in the morning and a herring at
tea. She said she had pain in her head all the last week. <i>I
believed she was suffering from epilepsy.</i> On leaving, the prisoner
returned with me; I made up a bottle of medicine, antispasmodic,
which he took away with him. I never saw her again alive.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>On cross-examination</i> he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He did not notice any such ‘arching’ as the witness Wilson
spoke of, nor did she mention it to him as one of the symptoms.
Nor should he call what he saw of the feet ‘arching.’ He had
only seen one case of epilepsy before&mdash;that was twelve months ago&mdash;and
the symptoms in it were very similar to what he saw in the
deceased. He saw the body immediately after death; there was no
‘arching’ of it then. If there had been he should have seen it.
She was lying, with her clothes on, on the bed. If there had been
any marked rigidity of the body he should have observed it; that
was a quarter of an hour after death.”</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Re-examined</i> by Mr. Poland.&mdash;“She had her clothes on when
he saw her, and part of her body might have been covered with the
bedclothes. In the case of epilepsy he referred to, the person died
in six hours. <i>He prescribed no pills, only the mixture.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">Proof was then given of the finding in the prisoner’s room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of six bottles of medicine, a box with two pills,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and a packet
of powder in dirty paper, and of their delivery to Dr. Lees,
and subsequently to Dr. Bernays for analysis. It was not,
however, until suspicions were aroused by other circumstances
(the finding of the body of the infant in the river) that a
<i>post-mortem</i> examination was held by Dr. Lees, and the contents
of the stomach and other interior parts of the body
analysed by him, and subsequently handed to Dr. Bernays for
the same purpose. In one of the bottles Dr. Bernays found
a distinct sediment of Prussian blue, pointing clearly to the
use of some vermin killer. Subsequently two kinds of these
dangerous preparations were submitted to and analysed by
him.</p>

<p class="psh">ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>Dr. Lees, M.D., of the Brixton Road, on the 18th of
September made a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the body in
conjunction with a Dr. Lewis. They found <i>no morbid
appearances to indicate the cause of death</i>&mdash;the limbs were
somewhat rigid, the body fairly nourished, and the stomach
showed no sign of irritant poison.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It contained,” said the witness, “six ounces of a thin reddish
fluid. I put the stomach and contents into a jar, and the viscera
into another. I received the bottles from the constable and the
paper of powder, and saw some pills at the inquest. Among the
bottles was one of the larger ones, which appeared to have contained
a few ounces of good sarsaparilla&mdash;it was empty and rinsed
out. One bottle contained about two grains of dried powder,
adhering to the bottle. I added to the bottle a few drachms of
water, two drachms of spirits of wine, thirty drops of hydrochloric
acid, and two grains of dried powder. My purpose up to that time
was to test for strychnia, but it was frustrated. What I had done
was not sufficient to enable me to form an opinion. I had previously
analysed a portion of a two-ounce phial, containing half a
drachm or thirty drops of a reddish brown fluid&mdash;half a spoonful.
I first tested five drops, and obtained clear evidence of strychnia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
I was enabled to separate from the rest a substance that yielded
strychnia. I used three separate tests; the second time with ten
drops, and obtained needle-shaped crystals. I showed the colour
to Dr. Bernays. I did not test the bottle for any other purpose.
I left the rest (five drops) in the bottle and corked it up. Half a
grain of strychnia is a fatal dose. I have been in practice fourteen
years, and am of opinion that if Mrs. Wilson’s description of the
symptoms is correct, they were consistent with death from strychnia.
They only resemble the disease known as <i>idiopathic tetanus</i>. If
Mrs. Wilson’s description is correct, the symptoms were not consistent
with anything I know except death by strychnia&mdash;it came
on so rapidly. If strychnia were administered in solution, the
symptoms would come on in a very few minutes. <i>Strychnia occasionally
produces irritation of the stomach.</i> The symptoms of
poisoning by it are the rapid occurrence of twitchings in the limbs
and rigidity of the muscles of the limbs, <i>usually commencing in the
lower extremities</i>; the sense of weight on the chest, the extension
of the spasms to the muscles of the trunk, the arching back of the
head, the intervals of consciousness, the absence of any great difficulty
in swallowing, and death in six hours. Mr. Miller’s evidence
is consistent with death from strychnia.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>The cross-examination</i> was, as in Mrs. Wilson’s case,
directed to the eliciting admissions in favour of the opinion,
at first adopted by Mr. Miller, that the death was due to
epilepsy.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Leaving out the ‘arching’” (opisthotonos), said the witness, “I
should hesitate to say she died of strychnia; it is a leading symptom,
and also that the intellect was clear at intervals. <i>Vomiting is not
usual in epilepsy.</i> It was <i>eight days</i> after death that I examined the
body. There was then <i>no rigidity beyond what I might expect in
death</i>. The lungs were congested, the heart flabby and decomposed,
spongy from putrefaction, and containing a little coagulated blood.
Taking the appearances of the whole <i>post-mortem</i> examination, <i>there
were no marked ones to account for death</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. A. J. Bernays, professor of chemistry at St. Thomas’s
Hospital, to whom the bottles and powder found in the room,
the jars with the stomach, intestines, and viscera, and a bottle
supposed to contain vomit,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> had been handed on the 28th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of October, reported the results of his analysis of their
contents.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In the organs (the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, intestines,
spleen, and blood) he found no poison of any kind. The stomach
was inflamed, and there was a <i>trace of strychnia</i>, but of no other
poison. In one bottle of medicine, opium, myrrh, but no strychnia,
were found, and in another only peppermint and asafœtida. The
powder was innocuous, consisting of old mustard and fenugreek.
In one nearly empty bottle was found a distinct sediment of
Prussian blue, one of the usual ingredients in ‘vermin powder.’
He was satisfied that what Dr. Lees showed him on a watch glass
was strychnia; on testing, it was found to contain the 1000th part
of a grain. On the 31st of October the inspector brought two
packets labelled <i>Battle’s Vermin Killer</i>. <i>Poison. Lincoln</i>&mdash;a light
blue powder, a threepenny and a sixpenny packet. The first consisted
of fifteen grains, containing wheat flour, Prussian blue, and
crystallised strychnia. The second packet, of the same composition
as the first, weighed thirty grains. The amount of strychnia was&mdash;in
the threepenny packet 10·69 per cent., in the sixpenny packet
10·06 per cent., corresponding to 1·6 grains in the smaller packet.
On the 9th November a threepenny and sixpenny packet of
<i>Butler’s Gloucestershire Vermin and Insect Killer for killing rats
and mice, &amp;c.</i>, was received, marked poison. The weight of the
two was fifty-six grains. It was a grey powder, containing flour,
soot, and barium carbonate, but no strychnia; but another packet
of the same contained flour, soot, strychnia, but no barium
carbonate. These ‘vermin killers,’ if used at all, should never be
made or sold except by the legitimate pharmaceutists of the country,
and under proper precautions.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Justice Denman.</i>&mdash;“A very proper suggestion for the consideration
of the legislature.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Thomas Stephenson, M.D.</i>, lecturer in chemistry at
Guy’s Hospital, agreed with Dr. Lees and Dr. Bernays, and
had no doubt of the correctness of their experiments.</p>

<p>It was also proved by the prisoner’s brother-in-law that the
prisoner was in the habit of taking sarsaparilla, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
whilst the prisoner lodged with him, the witness had been
using <i>Battle’s Vermin Killer</i>, as he was troubled with mice in
his room. This he had bought at a shop in the Vauxhall
Road, but he did not recollect having any of it left, or of
the prisoner using it in his room. The prisoner had left
Mrs. Wilson a few hours after the woman’s death, saying
he was going to telegraph down the line and would be absent
till the evening. He did not return until about nine on the
morning of the 11th, when he said his cousin would take
the child, which Mrs. Wilson dressed and gave to him, and
never saw it again until the 15th, when it was lying dead in
a public-house at Battersea, having been found drowned in
the river. He also promised Mrs. Wilson that he would
attend the woman’s funeral, but did not, and told her on one
occasion that he always had strychnia by him.</p>

<p><i>For the defence</i> Mr. Fulton urged that the evidence of the
“arching” of the body was very vague, and rested only on the
word of Mrs. Wilson, who had not mentioned this important
symptom either to the doctor or the coroner’s constable, and
that without that symptom the death might be accounted for
by epilepsy, and the first opinion of Dr. Miller justified. He
endeavoured to minimise the evidence of the analysts, and
argued that the conduct of the prisoner in his attendance on
his wife was a strong proof of his innocence. “Motive,”
he said, “there appeared to be none, as from his wages
the prisoner was quite able to bear the expense of the mother
and child.”</p>

<p>The jury, however, returned a verdict of “guilty,” and
the prisoner was executed on the 2nd of December, admitting
the justice of his sentence, and that he was a party to the
death of the child, but saying others were in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> species of Strychnos, of the natural order Loganiaceæ,
contain, mainly in their seeds, the alkaloids Strychnia
and Brucia in the proportion of one to one and a half per cent.
The plants yet proved to contain these two alkaloids are:&mdash;<i>Strychnos
nux-vomica</i> (bark and seeds), <i>Strychnos Ignatia</i>
(Faba amara, or St. Ignatius’s bean), <i>Strychnos Tieute</i> (the
Upas tree of Java), <i>Strychnos toxifera</i> (main source of woorara
or curare, the arrow poison of the South American Indians),
and <i>Strychnos Ligustrina</i> and <i>Colubrina</i> &mdash;“snakewood”), a
tree of Asia. <i>S. potatorum</i> &mdash;“clearing nut”) and <i>S. pseudokina</i>
are not poisonous.</p>

<p>In commerce, “Nux vomica,” “Faba amara, or St. Ignatius’s
bean,” “false Angostura bark” (the bark of Strychnos
nux-vomica), and an extract called “curare,” are met with.
The last is made by mixing the juice of the bark of Strychnos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
toxifera and another species with pepper and acrid plants; as
its effects depend upon “<i>curarine</i>,” another alkaloid, and not
upon strychnia, it will not enter much into our subject.</p>

<p>“<i>Faba Amara</i>,” St. Ignatius’s bean, contains 1·2 per cent.
Strychnia and some Brucia.</p>

<p>“<i>False Angostura Bark</i>” contains Strychnia and Brucia,
gives a light yellow powder, intensely bitter, and turned red
by nitric acid.</p>

<p><i>Nux Vomica</i>, a flattened circular seed, from half to one
inch diameter, generally concavo-convex, with a slight central
prominence. Colour greyish-brown; silky from radiating
hairs. Substance tough and horny; powder light brown,
with an odour like liquorice, and an intense and persistent
bitter taste. Nitric acid gives with the powder and with the
extract an orange-red colour, owing to the presence of <i>brucia</i>.
The aqueous infusion gives a precipitate with tannin, and an
olive-green tint with neutral ferric chloride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strychnia</span>, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, occurs in commerce in opaque
white rhombic prisms (the “right square octahedra” of the
British Pharmacopœia are not met with), inodorous, having a
sp. gr. of 1·36. One part of strychnia dissolves in 7000 parts
of cold, in 2500 parts of boiling, water; in 1250 parts of ether;
in 1000 of carbon disulphide; in 200 of <i>absolute</i> alcohol;
in 120 parts of cold, and 10 parts of hot, rectified spirit; in
181 parts of amylic alcohol; in 164 of benzene; and 7 of
chloroform. Creasote and essential and fixed oils also dissolve
strychnia (Blyth).</p>

<p>It sublimes in needle shaped crystals, or sometimes, if too
quickly heated, in drops, at 169° C.; melts at 221° C., finally
darkening and carbonizing.</p>

<p>Its bitter taste is its most prominent physical characteristic.
I have verified the statement that one grain of strychnia in a
gallon (70,000 grains) of water is distinctly perceptible. One
grain in 30,000 is markedly bitter.</p>

<p>Its salts are crystallizable, and also bitter, lævo-rotatory in
solution, mostly colourless, neutral to test-paper, generally
soluble with facility in water, hence more rapidly poisonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
than the free alkaloid. <i>Strychnia sulphates</i> occur in large
four-sided prisms, octahedrons, or needles, according to the
amount of water of crystallization. <i>Strychnia nitrate</i> crystallizes
in silky needles, easily soluble in water. The <i>sulphate</i>
is officinal in the French, the <i>nitrate</i> in the German, Austrian,
Swiss, Norwegian, and Dutch Pharmacopœias. The acetate
and hydrochloride are met with in commerce, but are not
officinal. <i>Strychnia</i> itself, the free alkaloid, is prescribed in
the British Pharmacopœia. <i>Liquor strychniæ</i> is a solution of
the hydrochloride.</p>

<p><i>Separation.</i>&mdash;Strychnia is probably the easiest of the
alkaloids to detect, on account of its stability and the delicacy
of its reactions. One half-millionth of a grain in the pure
state is discoverable by the colour tests (Pharm. Journ., July,
1856). Putrefaction does not change it, for Richter detected
it in tissues after <i>eleven years</i> (Sammlung Klin. Vorträge,
69, 562), and other observers in decomposed or buried bodies
after five to eight weeks. And yet there are few analysts who
have not on some occasion failed to find it (see p. 147.) A
very small quantity, about a grain, may destroy life. Even of
this, only a portion is absorbed; the rest is eliminated by
vomiting (when it occurs), and by the urine and fæces; the absorbed
portion is diffused with great rapidity through a large
mass of blood and tissue; the result is that we are looking
for <i>one part</i> of the poison in about a <i>million times</i> its weight
of impurities&mdash;almost worse than the needle in the haystack.
Matters are still more difficult if the theory be true that an
alkaloid, in killing, itself suffers change (see pp. 128 and
133)&mdash;an idea that Dr. Letheby and Mr. Nunneley strongly
repudiated in the Palmer defence, though the latter witness
had to admit that he himself had once failed to detect strychnia
in an animal to which he had administered it. Dragendorff
records several negative results without apparent cause.
Taylor (Med. Jur., 1873, Vol. I., 414) mentions cases of
non-discovery by Dr. Reese of Philadelphia, Mr. Horsley of
Cheltenham, by himself in the organs of an animal hypodermically
poisoned; and also a case in which <i>five grains</i> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
been taken, and only a little over a grain was found. Sonnenschein
(Casper’s Handbook) in one case found a quantity
in the stomach, but none in the tissues; yet it had caused
death. All these facts greatly support the theory that the
alkaloid is itself changed in causing death.</p>

<p>However this be, if the stomach has failed to yield strychnia,
the whole of the rest of the organs, the blood, and the muscles&mdash;in
fact, as much of the body as can be managed&mdash;should be
extracted with hot redistilled methylated spirit acidified with
a little acetic acid. It is easy to fit up an arrangement with
a stoneware pan, a wooden cover, and a coil of tin pipe,
through which steam can be passed, and thus the alcohol can
be kept warm for two or three hours without much loss.
Strain the whole through a cloth, distil off most of the
alcohol, evaporate on a water bath at about 70° C., and treat
the extract as described in the general process for alkaloids.
To facilitate the purification, the alcoholic solution may be
precipitated by acetate of lead (<i>avoiding much excess</i>), filtered,
the lead removed from the filtrate by adding sufficient sulphate
of potash in solution and allowing it to settle, and the clear
liquid evaporated as before. Much syrupy matter, which
occasions trouble, is thus removed.</p>

<p>The ether-chloroform solution (p. 5), by spontaneous
evaporation, leaves the strychnia in “rosettes, veined leaves,
stellate dotted needles, circles with broken radii, and branched
and reticulated forms” (Guy and Ferrier, Forens. Med.,
1881, 568). If not yet pure enough to crystallize, advantage
may be taken of the fact that while most of the impurities
are charred by warm concentrated sulphuric acid, strychnia
is very little affected. A few drops of this acid are therefore
added to the residue, then it is warmed for ten or fifteen
minutes on the water-bath, finally diluted to about ten cubic
centimetres, filtered, the filter washed with water, and the
filtrate treated again with ammonia and ether-chloroform.
The residue left by the latter, on spontaneous evaporation,
will now be pure enough for the following</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tests.</span>&mdash;1. The microscopic appearances are so various as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to be somewhat indefinite; Guy’s description has been already
given. If <i>no</i> crystals are found, strychnia and most other
alkaloids are unlikely to be present. But if crystals <i>are</i>
obtained, they frequently, on further examination, prove to
be some inorganic salt or an ammonium compound, leading
to wrong conclusions, if the microscope be trusted too
much.</p>

<p>2. Dissolve in water with a trace of acid, and divide on
several watch-glasses, as described in the introduction. If
one portion be cautiously <i>tasted</i>, and there be no bitterness,
strychnia is very improbable.</p>

<p>3. Proceed at once to the <i>colour test</i>. Transfer a portion
of the residue, dissolved in a drop of acetic acid, to a white
porcelain dish or plate; dry gently on the water-bath; moisten
it with about two drops of pure concentrated sulphuric acid;
<i>strychnia gives no coloration</i>; with the point of a knife
place a minute quantity of finely-powdered peroxide of manganese
(the precipitated hydrate is often recommended, but
the natural peroxide answers better, being more gradual in
its action) on the side of the dish; slant the dish so as to
allow the liquid to come in contact with the powder. At the
moment of contact a <i>deep rich blue</i> colour is produced if
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20000th</sub> of a grain of strychnia be present. The blue colour
rapidly changes into <i>purple</i>, <i>crimson</i>, <i>rich red-brown</i>, then
fades into <i>bright orange-red</i>, which last tint remains for some
hours. By cautiously stirring with a glass rod, the succession
of colours can be brought out again at another spot. One or
two other qualified observers should always be summoned to
witness the experiment, for two reasons; <i>first</i>, that they may
testify at the trial, if necessary, to the certainty of the conclusion;
<i>secondly</i>, because the sense of colour is differently
developed in different people, and, if the hues are faint, one
is apt to imagine what one expects to find. But if two or
three, without prompting, see the same appearances, the
chance of error is removed.</p>

<p>Applied in this way, the succession of colours is <i>absolutely
peculiar to strychnia</i>. But, as objections have been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
that these can be produced from other substances, they may
as well be discussed and disposed of.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Curarine</i> (from Strychnos toxifera) has a bitter taste, is
almost insoluble in ether and chloroform; hence it is not
usually extracted by the above alkaloidal process, but remains
behind in the aqueous liquid. With sulphuric acid and
peroxide of manganese it gives the same colours as strychnia,
but the changes are slower. <i>With sulphuric acid alone</i>, it
yields a pale violet colour, changing to dirty red, and finally
to rose. Its physiological effects are opposite to those of
strychnia&mdash;so much so that it has been proposed as an
antidote.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Pyroxanthine</i> (a rare substance, obtained in very small
quantity from wood spirit), <i>salicine</i> (from the willow), and
<i>piperine</i> (from pepper), give <i>with sulphuric acid alone</i> a deep-red
colour, destroyed or spoilt by peroxide of manganese.
(Nunneley, in Palmer’s trial.)</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If sugar and bile should be present together, sulphuric
acid will develope a purple colour very like the strychnia test.
Bile would also give bitterness. But it must be remembered
that bile, without sugar, will not give the colour, that sugar
will not be extracted by the ether-chloroform, and that the
colour will appear immediately on the addition of the acid
alone, whereas strychnia remains then uncoloured.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Many resinous and saccharine matters are coloured by
sulphuric acid, but can be got rid of by warming with the acid
as described above.</p>

<p>So that none of these can be mistaken for strychnia. This
important test depends upon the action of nascent oxygen;
hence any substance which yields oxygen will give the colours
more or less satisfactorily. Bichromate of potash, potassium
ferricyanide, peroxide of lead, peroxide of cerium (Sonnenschein),
have been employed, but most of them give colours of
their own, and none are so good as peroxide of manganese. It
is only necessary that the manganese should be finely pounded
and not too much added. The action is slower and more
lasting than with bichromate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Letheby’s galvanic test is interesting, and has the advantage
of not introducing any extraneous substance into the
matter under examination, so that another alkaloid can be
tested for afterwards. I have found it better to place the
drop of supposed strychnia solution, acidified with a drop of
dilute sulphuric acid (10 per cent. strength) on a white plate,
to place on its opposite sides two small pieces of platinum
foil pressed closely against the plate, touching the drop, and
approaching within a quarter of an inch of one another, and
to touch them simultaneously with the terminals of a battery
of <i>two</i> Grove’s or other cells. In the region of the positive
terminal the same colours manifest themselves as with
peroxide of manganese. If no colour is shown at once, the
battery should be removed, as further galvanic action may
decompose any other alkaloid that may be present. The test
is not so delicate as sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese.</p>

<p>It is said that the presence of much <i>morphia</i> will interfere
with the above test. But morphia, again, is not extracted
completely by the ether-chloroform; and I have not found it
to hinder the reaction if performed carefully.</p>

<p>Brucia in ordinary quantities, quinine, cinchonine, veratrine,
and santonine do not interfere. In strychnia poisoning, morphia
should always be sought for, as it is used as an antidote.
If found, its interference may be obviated thus. Dissolve the
supposed strychnia in water with a little acetic acid, add an
equal volume of <i>ether</i>, and then ammonia in slight excess,
and shake well. The strychnia will dissolve in the ether, the
morphia will remain in the aqueous liquid. On evaporating
the ether, the strychnia will be isolated.</p>

<p>4. Dr. Marshall Hall’s <i>physiological test</i> is very delicate.
With some small animal&mdash;preferably a frog&mdash;proceed as mentioned
in the introduction (p. 6). Tetanic spasms are caused.
But other poisons, ptomaines, and even the mechanical injury,
may produce irritation and perhaps convulsions, so that the
test is dangerous, except as confirmatory or negative.</p>

<p>5. <i>Bichromate of potash</i> solution gives with strychnia, at
once or on standing, a yellow precipitate, appearing under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
microscope as rectangular plates and prisms. (See Guy and
Ferrier’s Forensic Medicine, p. 567.)</p>

<p>6. A sublimate of strychnia touched with a drop of dilute
<i>picric acid</i> solution, strength 1 in 250, gives microscopic
arborescent crystallizations of peculiar <i>curved</i> forms. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p>7. Treated with concentrated sulphuric acid and then with
a crystal of sodium nitrite, strychnia gives a dirty yellow
colour, changed by an alcoholic solution of potash to a fine
orange-red, by an aqueous solution to brownish green, and
finally to dirty red-brown. (Arnold, Arch. d. Pharm. 3, 20,
561.)</p>

<p>8. Mercuric chloride produces a white precipitate, as also
does potassium sulphocyanide. All the general reagents for
alkaloids precipitate strychnia. If, however, the reaction with
sulphuric acid and manganese have come out properly, all the
other tests are superfluous; if it has <i>not</i> been obtained, none
of the other tests will be of use.</p>

cent., the rest being <i>Potato</i> starch and Prussian blue. Woodman
and Tidy (For. Med. p. 329) found 23 per cent. strychnia,
with sugar, flour, and Prussian blue. Bernays found 10·7
per cent. of strychnia, with flour and Prussian blue. (Barlow’s
case.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Butler’s</i> contains flour, soot, and about 5 per cent.
strychnia. Sometimes it contains Prussian blue, and sometimes
carbonate of barium in place of strychnia.</p>

<p>3. <i>Gibson’s</i> contains half a grain of strychnia in each
powder.</p>

<p>4. <i>Miller’s Rat Powder</i> contains oatmeal, and about 6 per
cent. of nux vomica (equal to 0·023 strychnia and 0·067
brucia). (Blyth, Man. of Prac. Chem. p. 317.)</p>

<p>5. <i>Marsden’s Vermin and Insect Killer</i>: one packet contains
¾ grain strychnia. (Lancet, April 19, 1856.)</p>

<p>6. <i>Barber’s</i> “<i>Magic Vermin Killer Powders</i>” weigh 28
grains and contain 10 per cent. of strychnia. “Hunter’s
Infallible” also contains it.</p>

<p>In <i>Keating’s Insect Powder</i> I have found no strychnia nor
arsenic.</p>

<p class="psh">BRUCIA.</p>

<p>C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, is probably derived from strychnia
by the substitution of two molecules of methoxyl (CH<sub>3</sub>O) for
two atoms of hydrogen (Shenstone, Chem. Soc. Journal, Feb.,
1883), hence might be named <i>dimethoxystrychnia</i>. But
efforts to change it into strychnia have, as yet, been unsuccessful.
All plants containing strychnia contain also brucia.
In <i>false Angostura bark</i> the latter much predominates.
It occurs in needles or 4-sided monoclinic prisms (rarely
in tables), colourless, intensely bitter, lævo-rotatory to a
less extent than strychnia, but more soluble in water,
alcohol, &amp;c., hence remaining in the mother liquors in
the preparation of strychnia. Insoluble in pure ether. It
melts at 151° C. (Blyth), and produces a scanty amorphous
sublimate near its temperature of decomposition. The salts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
are neutral, easily soluble in water, and crystallize in needles
(the acetate with difficulty). Its physiological action is the
same as strychnia, but six or seven times weaker.</p>

<p>With the general reagents for alkaloids brucia gives precipitates.
With <i>concent. nitric acid</i> it gives a deep-red colour,
changing to orange, and finally to yellow. A trace of stannous
chloride (protochloride of tin) turns the red solution purple:
excess bleaches it.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> This test is very delicate. In former
times commercial strychnia always contained brucia, hence
the coloration by nitric acid was even looked upon as a test
for strychnia (see p. 125, and p. 156). But, as the strychnia
now sold is generally pure, it gives no colour with nitric acid
in the cold. Therefore, if both strychnia and brucia are found
in a product extracted from the animal tissues, it follows that
<i>Nux Vomica</i>, or one of the plants, or their preparations, has
been used, and not the pure alkaloid. The microscope in this
case will generally detect some of the vegetal tissue or hairs
in the stomach.</p>

<p>Concent. sulphuric acid, followed by bichromate of potash,
gives with brucia a red-brown colour passing to green and
yellow (Guy).</p>

<p>Whenever strychnia is found, brucia should also be looked
for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Igasuria</span>, a supposed third alkaloid of the Strychnos tribe,
has been shown by Shenstone to be a mixture of strychnia and
brucia (Chem. Soc. Journal, Sept. 1881, p. 457).</p>

<p><i>Strychnic or Igasuric Acid</i>, obtained by Pelletier and
Caventun from Nux Vomica and from St. Ignatius’ Bean, is
probably identical with malic acid.</p>

<p class="psh">DOSES.</p>

<p><i>Medicinal dose</i> of strychnia <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> grain. <i>Fatal dose</i>:
smallest recorded ½ grain (Dr. Warner, “Poisoning by
Strychnia,” p. 138), ¼ grain (Guy; also case of Agnes Sennett,
p. 121, <i>ante</i>), but a child of two or three years was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
killed by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> grain (Christison): average for adults, ½ to 2
grains (Taylor).</p>

<p><i>Recovery</i> has taken place after 3 grains (Taylor), 4 grains
(Lancet, 1863, i. 54), 3 to 7 grains (Husemann), 7 grains
(Med. Gaz., xli., 305), “20 grains or more” (? Guy and
Ferrier’s Forens. Med., 1881, p. 574), 40 grains (Med.
Times and Gaz., 1865, p. 267). If these statements are
correct, they must be accounted for either by vomiting, early
and vigorous treatment, or impurity of the alkaloid.</p>

<p>Poisonous symptoms have sometimes occurred in adults,
and frequently in children, from medicinal doses.</p>

<p><i>Fatal close of nux vomica</i>: of the powder, 30 grains is the
smallest (= ⅓ grain strychnia), (Hoffmann, Med. Rat. System,
2, 175), of the alcoholic extract, 3 grains (Christison on
Poisons, p. 642).</p>

<p><i>Brucia</i> is not used in medicine. <i>Fatal dose</i> rather uncertain,
probably three to ten grains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fatal Period for Strychnia</span>:&mdash;Shortest, five minutes
(Dr. Gray on Strychnia, 1872, p. 55); longest, six hours
after three grains (Taylor, Guy’s Hosp. Reports, Oct., 1857,
p. 483); average, two hours. <i>For nux vomica</i>:&mdash;Shortest,
fifteen minutes; longest, three hours or more (Guy); average,
two hours (Taylor), one hour (Guy).</p>

<p><i>Symptoms commence</i> at various intervals after taking,
according to dose, form, and constitution. The beginning
may be (1) almost immediate (Mad. Merghelynk, 1870,
Taylor’s Med. Juris., p. 408), (2) in five minutes (case of Dr.
Warner, also Dr. Gray on Strychnia, 1872, p. 55), (3) in
fifteen minutes (trial of Dove, p. 242), (4) about an hour (Palmer’s
trial, p. 102), (5) forty minutes (Lond. Med. Repository,
xix., 448), up to two and a half hours (Wormley, Microchemistry
of Poisons, p. 538). Hence no conclusion can
safely be drawn from this feature (see Dr. Letheby’s evidence
in the Palmer trial, p. 166). Probably Dr. Todd’s statement
in the same trial is the most correct average:&mdash;“Symptoms
in ten minutes, if in solution and a large dose; otherwise in
a half to one hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The different action of powder and solution is shown in the
following experiments on two full-grown rats:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Half a grain of <i>powdered</i> strychnia&mdash;First convulsion in
twenty minutes, death in two and a half hours.</p>

<p>2. Same quantity <i>dissolved</i> in sufficient acid&mdash;Effect almost
immediate; death in half an hour. In the stomach, liver,
and brain, strychnia was separately detected.</p>

<p>Pills, especially if hard, would be very slow in action. The
most intense effect is produced by hypodermic injection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms in Man</span>:&mdash;Bitter taste in the mouth, feeling of
suffocation, jerkings and twitchings of head and limbs, then
tetanic convulsions of nearly all the muscles. Body stretched
out stiff, finally arched back so as to rest on the head and
the heels (opisthotonos), spasmodic and difficult breathing,
usually a peculiar grin (risus sardonicus). <i>After a time the
jaw becomes tightly fixed</i> (trismus or lockjaw), the fingers are
clenched, the feet arched inwards (incurvated), the eyes
prominent and staring. The spasm lasts from a half to two
minutes, then there is an interval of comparative rest. The
pupils are generally <i>dilated</i> during the fit, <i>contracted</i> in the
interval. A touch, a change of position, or a sudden noise,
will usually cause a renewal of the spasm. In severe cases
the convulsions recur at diminishing intervals, increasing in
violence till death occurs from exhaustion or suffocation.
Vomiting is very rare. Taylor says “the jaw is not always
fixed during a paroxysm: the patient can frequently speak
and swallow” (Med. Juris., 1873, p. 404). Woodman and
Tidy (Forens. Med., 1877, p. 330) say that this symptom is
invariably present. Guy and Ferrier are cautious, and state
that the effort to drink often causes rigid spasms of the jaw,
but that the “jaw is not always fixed, even in the fit” (Guy
and Ferrier’s Forens. Med., 1881, p. 573). On the whole,
fixing of the jaw is usual but not invariable. In the Palmer
and Dove trials the patients spoke or shrieked during the
paroxysms.</p>

<p>As to impatience of touch, Mr. Morley’s dictum in the
Dove trial expresses the truth: “<i>Not</i> shrinking from touch is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
<i>consistent</i> with strychnia, but a desire not to be touched is an
<i>indication</i> of it. Several cases of strychnia had desired to be
rubbed.” See also the cases of Mrs. Smyth and Mr. Clutterbuck,
pp. 122 and 123.</p>

<p>Consciousness, in the immense majority of cases, is preserved
to the last. If, as in Mrs. Dove, insensibility occurs,
it is due to the exhaustion. In this trial Dr. Christison said
“it is unusual to be insensible before death from strychnia.”
Farquharson (Therapeutics, p. 264) states that “the cerebral
functions remain unimpaired almost up to the close.” This
is agreed to by all authorities.</p>

<p>The symptoms of strychnia poisoning have been explained
away by the defence as “hysteria,” “idiopathic tetanus,”
“epileptic convulsions with tetanic complications” (Dr.
Macdonald in Palmer’s trial), “angina pectoris” (Dr.
Richardson), “apoplexy” (Dr. Bamford’s certificate). Gritty
granules on the spinal cord, sexual or other excitement, cold
and damp, drink, &amp;c., were in that trial assigned as causes.
As to “gritty granules,” the expression is not clear; such
granules as occurred in Cook have been found in many <i>post-mortems</i>,
where they certainly did not cause the death.
Sexual excitement was out of the question in this case.
Drink does not cause tetanus. The cold and damp were
hardly sufficient reasons, as no symptoms of chill were
noticed. Apoplexy is distinct, as in this the <i>brain</i> would
show the disease.</p>

<p><i>Hysteria</i>, <i>epilepsy</i>, and <i>idiopathic tetanus</i> (tetanus which is
“constitutional,” or not occasioned by external injury) produce
in some cases insensibility; strychnia, as a rule, does
not. They are also <i>continuous</i> in symptoms. <i>Traumatic
tetanus</i> is caused by a wound or injury, rarely by ulcers or
syphilitic sores (see p. 113). If there be none of these it
cannot, of course, be traumatic tetanus. <i>Hysteria</i> is exceedingly
variable, and simulates many other diseases: it is
generally the result of excitement. But it does not produce
opisthotonos. <i>Epilepsy</i> has never such symptoms as strychnia
occasions: it rarely supervenes without some history of hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
tendency, and it is always attended by unconsciousness
(p. 151). <i>Idiopathic tetanus</i> may occur from a cold (see a
case of Dr. Todd’s, Lond. Med. Gaz., Nov., 1850), or from
no assignable cause. It is very close to strychnia in symptoms,
but the latter is much more rapid: the shortest
recorded fatal period for natural tetanus being twelve hours
&mdash;“even here the early symptoms had been probably overlooked”&mdash;Sir
B. Brodie), the usual about eight days. In
both kinds of tetanus the jaw is usually the <i>first</i>, in strychnia
the <i>last</i> part to be affected. <i>Angina pectoris</i> Dr. Richardson
himself disposed of, as in the case he mentions he says that
had he known more at the time he would have suspected
strychnia (see Palmer’s trial, p. 176). The symptoms of this
disease, as given in the leading works, differ much from
strychnia poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Post-Mortem Appearances.</span>&mdash;Neither characteristic nor
uniform (Guy and Ferrier). As a rule, the body is relaxed
at death, and stiffens afterwards (Taylor), but occasionally
the reverse is the case (<i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Vyse</i>, Central Criminal Court,
1862).<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Sometimes the rigidity, as in Cook’s case, remains
for months. Clinching of the hands, arching of the feet, are
nearly always present, but they may likewise be noticed in
cases of natural death (Casper, quoted by Taylor, Med. Jur.,
p. 406; also Prof. Partridge’s evidence in the Palmer trial,
p. 172&mdash;“half-bent hands and fingers, not uncommon after
natural death”). <i>Brain, spinal cord, and lungs almost invariably
congested.</i> Blood dark and fluid. In some cases
the heart is full of blood, especially on the right side, but
occasionally it is empty and contracted. Stomach generally
healthy, rarely congested. Casper found a dark violet colour
of the muscles of the throat and gullet; this was the only
peculiarity he noticed, and even this has not occurred in other
cases. On the whole, the diagnosis must depend mainly on
the symptoms during life, though the congestion mentioned
above is a valuable corroborative from the post-mortem. Involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
evacuation of urine and fæces generally occurs, but
is usual in all painful deaths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment and Antidotes.</span>&mdash;The question will often arise
in a trial whether the best means were taken of saving the
patient. In Tawell’s trial it was actually suggested that the
water poured down the throat may have caused the death by
choking! If emetics are used, they are all more or less
poisons. If the stomach-pump be employed, it will cause
irritation and exhaustion. Nevertheless, where a violent
poison has been given, the only hope is in strong remedies&mdash;to
empty the stomach by emetics or the pump, to give tannin
or animal charcoal, and to generally sustain nature during the
operations. As the inquiry is, “What caused death?” the
defence will frequently endeavour to fasten the responsibility
on the remedial measures. <i>These would not of themselves be
fatal</i>, unless disease or poison had previously brought the
patient to a nearly dying state; whether it be disease or
poison will be otherwise determined.</p>

<p>The direct antidote to strychnia is <i>chloroform</i>. In animals
I have noticed a large percentage of recoveries. Woodman
and Tidy (Forens. Med., p. 332) give the majority of recoveries
to this agent.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> I believe that most cases could be saved if,
on the approach of the convulsions, they could be put <i>vigorously
under the action of chloroform</i>. Chloral hydrate, nicotine,
opium, &amp;c., have been also tried with scanty success. Tannin
precipitates strychnia, as well as most other alkaloids; hence
may be useful as an adjunct. When the jaw is fixed, liquids
can only be given through a tube; even teeth have been taken
out to effect this. Enemata may also be used. Artificial
respiration should be cautiously tried. Curara and Calabar
Bean are dangerous and not effective.</p>

<p>Death or recovery is always rapid; if a person lives over
five or six hours, the case is hopeful (Woodman and Tidy).</p>

<p>One or two considerations remain. Dr. Taylor’s evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in the Palmer trial, though in most points it has been corroborated
by subsequent authorities, contained the following
statements that require rectifying:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) “<i>The colour tests are fallacious</i>” (pp. 144 and 147).
They are quite decisive if properly performed, and the precautions
remembered.</p>

<p>(2.) “<i>I know of no process which can detect strychnia in
the tissues</i>” (p. 133). This has been repeatedly done by the
same method as is used for the stomach. Dr. Taylor himself
admits it in his later works (see Med. Juris., 1873, p. 415).
No operator now neglects the tissues. They should always
be forwarded for analysis at the same time as the stomach,
but in separate jars.</p>

<p>If indications be obtained, the question will occur&mdash;“Could
they be due to Selmi’s ptomaine, resembling strychnia?”
If we consider that in an immense multitude of cases of
suspicion, where there is no clue, strychnia is tested for but
<i>not found</i>, it is evident that this natural imitation of the
alkaloid must be decidedly rare. So that the overwhelming
probability, if the colour test has been obtained, is that
strychnia itself is present.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Palmer afterwards is said to have more or
less admitted that he poisoned Cook, “<i>but not with
strychnia</i>.” Though the word of such a man is of little value,
there are others who have been of this opinion. Mr. Justice
Grove is reported to have expressed some hesitation afterwards
on this point. Mr. Nunneley, who, although he
showed too much partizanship in the trial, yet may be said to
have certainly had great experience with animals, asserted
that the symptoms did not quite coincide with strychnia.
Others followed in this train. The assertion is certainly
wrong, but Dr. Guy (Forens. Med. 1881, p. 525) has made a
suggestion that may be noticed. After quoting Dr. Shearman’s
case of a patient who had taken one and a-half grain of
<i>morphia</i> acetate, and who was seized with “twitching of the
limbs and face, difficulty in swallowing, spasms of the arms,
legs, and abdomen, partial opisthotonos, and great activity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the reflex function” (Med. Times and Gazette, March 7,
1857); another case from orfila, when <i>twenty-two</i> grains of
morphia hydrochloride had caused lockjaw, tension of the
abdomen, and occasional convulsions; and Castaing’s case,
when twenty-six grains of morphia acetate, and twelve grains
of tartar emetic, had been purchased, and the victim had
“vomiting, purging, convulsions, lockjaw, rigid spasms of
the neck and abdomen, inability to swallow, loss of sensibility
in the legs, contracted pupils, and stertorous breathing,”
Dr. Guy goes on to say that as Cook had probably three
grains of morphia acetate within seventy-two hours, and had
previously been reduced by tartar emetic, his death may have
been due to <i>morphia</i> and not to strychnia. But setting aside
the second and third cases where the dose was so large, Cook’s
symptoms did not on the whole agree with those of Dr.
Shearman’s patient. The dose in the time was not larger,
but the effects on Cook were immensely more severe. If
these be examples of morphia in its worst and most anomalous
aspect, it certainly cannot dispute with strychnia for the
responsibility of Cook’s death.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> See also Dr. Todd’s remark,
p. 117.</p>

<p>The three preparations of “gritty granules” on the spinal
cord in the museum of St. Thomas’s Hospital, “in which the
patients are said to have died from tetanus” (Mr. Nunneley’s
evidence, p. 152, also Dr. Macdonald’s evidence, p. 180), are
in section N, numbers 113, 114, and 115. They are described
in the catalogue as&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“113. Several small patches of earthy matter on the arachnoid
of the medulla spinalis.”</p>

<p>“114. A spinal cord. There are numerous large plates
of bone on the arachnoid of the lumbar portion, and of the
cauda equina.”</p>

<p>“115. A similar preparation. The plates of bone extend
as high as the upper dorsal vertebræ.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Charles Stewart, professor of comparative anatomy
and curator of the museum at St. Thomas’s, tells me that
these are calcareous, but not true bone, that they are not
uncommon in post-mortems where they have had nothing to
do with death, and that if the above had died from tetanus it
would probably have been recorded in the catalogue. As
there is no mention of the cause of death, it is certain that it
had no reference to the so-called “granules.”</p>

<p>The assertion of Mr. Morley (Dove’s Case, p. 245), that
strychnia is decomposed into its elements, is obviously incorrect,
probably an error of the reporter.</p>

<p>See also an interesting case lately reported (J. de Pharm.
et de Chimie, November 1882), where strychnia was found,
and also arsenic, in the stomach, liver, and brain.</p>

<p>Dr. John Harley tells me that he finds <i>hemlock juice</i> the
best antidote to the convulsions of all kinds of <i>tetanus</i>. He
has had many successful cases. Messrs. Mavor, veterinary
surgeons, find this remedy most efficacious with horses, in
which animal <i>tetanus</i> is very common.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">TRIALS FOR POISONING BY ARSENIC.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> the difficulties thrown in the way of the
purchase of arsenic by the “Sale of Arsenic Regulation Act”
of 1852, the cases of poisoning by the use of this drug have
been so numerous, that it has been difficult to select examples
without greatly extending the bulk of this volume. I have,
therefore, limited the full reports in this chapter to two,
namely:&mdash;(1). The case of Miss Madeline Smith for the
imputed murder of her lover, Pierre Emile L’Angelier in
Glasgow, tried before the “Lords of the Justiciary,” the chief
criminal court of Scotland, in Edinburgh, on the 30th of June,
1857, a case full of interest and doubt, the mystery of which
will probably never be disclosed; and (2) that of Ann Merritt
for the murder of her husband, tried at the Old Bailey, March
8th, 1850, on the verdict in which arose a notable difference
of opinion between leading medical and other experts, and
the chief medical witness, as to the possibility of fixing,
with any definiteness, the time at which the arsenic found in
the body had been administered; resulting in the eventual
commutation of the capital sentence by Sir George Grey, the
Home Secretary. This was the case referred to by the
Attorney-General in his cross-examination of Dr. Letheby in
Palmer’s trial. For the trial of Madeline Smith I have relied
on the Report reprinted with additions and corrections from
“The Scotsman,” by far the most accurate that I have read.

<p class="psh">THE HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p><i>Pierre Emile L’Angelier</i>, a Frenchman by birth, had been
employed in Scotland since the year 1843, when he was with
a firm of nurserymen at Dundee. How long he stayed with
them was not proved, but according to his own statement he was
one of the National Guard in the Revolution in Paris in 1848.
He was always a poor man, and in 1851, when again in Scotland,
was in such straits that he was living at a tavern in Edinburgh
on the charity of its proprietor. When there he was
at times in very low spirits, crying at night, and speaking of
committing suicide, getting out of bed and walking about the
room weeping, and on one occasion on the point apparently
of throwing himself out of the window of his room had he
not been prevented by his companion. Some love affairs&mdash;one
with an English lady, another with a lady in Fife&mdash;were the
causes he assigned for his melancholy and depression. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
letter, probably of this date, he wrote, “I never was so unhappy
in my life. I wish I had the courage to blow my brains
out.” In 1852 he was in the employ of another nurseryman
at Dundee, still harping on his disappointment in love, complaining
bitterly of the last lady’s intended marriage with
another&mdash;gloomy, moody, dull, and threatening to stab
himself. Vain of his person, he was always talking of his
success with ladies, and of what he should do if he was
again jilted. On one occasion, when speaking of the use of
arsenic for improving the coats of horses, and asked if he
was not afraid of poisoning them, he said, “Oh, no: so far
from doing that, he had taken it himself, without any bad
effects.” From this employment he went to that of Messrs.
Huggins and Co., of Glasgow, where he was looked upon as
a steady, industrious clerk, “a well-behaved, well-principled,
religious man.” Whilst with this firm he pressed a young
friend to introduce him to Miss Smith; and thus sprang up
the attachment which led to the catastrophe.</p>

<p><i>Miss Madeline Smith</i>, to whom L’Angelier was introduced
towards the end of 1854, was the daughter of an architect of
position in Glasgow, and had lately returned from an English
boarding-school. She was attractive in person, and just of
the age to fall violently in love with such a plausible, goodlooking
man as L’Angelier. As her parents naturally had
little liking for a merchant’s clerk as their daughter’s husband,
the love affair that arose at once after the introduction was
carried on clandestinely by a voluminous correspondence, in
which more than 200 letters passed from her to the deceased
in the brief period of their attachment, and such stolen
interviews in or out of her father’s house as could be arranged
with the connivance of one of his servants. According
to the theory of the prosecution, L’Angelier was an accomplished
and deliberate seducer, who at last gained his purpose
on the 6th of May, from which date Miss Smith’s letters to
her lover speak plainly of matters of which even married
persons would be reticent, and are couched in language suitable
only to married persons. She was clearly in L’Angelier’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
power, who wished to marry her, and made more than one
arrangement for an elopement. Towards the end of 1856,
however, her affection for him began to cool, and with reason.
She had accepted the attentions of a Mr. Minnoch, with the
full consent of her parents, and shortly after actually fixed
the day for her marriage with him. The danger of her
situation pressed upon her. L’Angelier, when he knew of
this, was not the man to sit tamely under such a slight, or to
let another person marry one of whom he knew so much to
her discredit. She wrote him to return her letters, begged
and prayed him to do so, and let the engagement drop, to
which she never could get the sanction of her parents. He
refused. He had heard a rumour of the Minnoch engagement,
and he threatened to send the letters to her father.
Still it was not revenge that he wanted; he wanted his wife.
Her letters at this time give the most painful proofs of the
state of mind into which she had fallen. “On her bended
knees,” she wrote, begging “him not to expose her, for
her mother’s sake,” and “the dread of her father’s anger.”
“As you hope for mercy at the judgment day, do not inform
on me; do not make me a public shame. There is no one I
love. My love was all given to you. My heart is empty,
cold. I am unloved. I am despised. I told you I had
ceased to love. It is true.” Such was her letter, presumably
of the 11th of February, 1857. At this time she was engaged
to Minnoch, and the day of the marriage, if not actually fixed,
had been talked about. She begged for an interview. In
the postscript to this sad letter, she added: “I will take you
within the door; the area gate will be open. I shall see you
from my window, twelve o’clock. I will wait till one o’clock.”
The exact date of this letter could not be proved, as it had
been delivered and not posted. It was dated only Tuesday
evening, twelve o’clock; and however ingenious was the
argument of the Lord Advocate, it failed to satisfy the court
that it produced an interview on the 11th which led to another
on the 19th&mdash;the day on which, according to the Crown, she
first administered the poison to her lover, from which arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the first of his illnesses, as described by Mrs. Jenkins, his
landlady.</p>

<p>Previously to the trial, the following explanation of the
connection with L’Angelier had been given by the prisoner,
in her examination before the Sheriff Substitute of Lanarkshire
on the 31st of March, “when,” he said, “she
answered his questions without hesitation, and with great
appearance of frankness and candour.”</p>

<p class="psh">DECLARATION OF THE PRISONER.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“I am a native of Glasgow, 21 years of age, and reside with my
father at No. 7, Blythswood Square, Glasgow. For about two
years I have been acquainted with P. Emile L’Angelier, who was
in the employment of Huggins &amp; Co., in Bothwell Street, and
resided at 10, Franklin Place. He recently paid his addresses to
me, and I have met him on a variety of occasions. I heard of his
death on the afternoon of the 23rd of March from my mother. <i>I
had not seen him for about three weeks before his death</i>, and the last
time I saw him was on a night about half-past ten o’clock. On
that occasion he tapped at my window, which is on the ground
floor and fronts Main Street. I talked to him from the window,
which is stanchioned outside, and I did not go out to him, nor did
he come into me. This occasion, which, as already said, was the
last, <i>was about three weeks before his death, and was the last time I
saw him</i>. He was in the habit of writing notes to me, and I was
in the habit of replying to them. The last note I wrote <i>was on
the Friday before his death, the 20th of March</i>. (Identifies note and
envelope.) <i>In consequence of that note I expected him to visit me on
Saturday the 21st, at my bedroom window, in the same way as before,
but he did not come and sent no notice. There was no tapping at
my window on the Saturday night, nor on the Sunday following.</i> I
went to bed on the Saturday night about eleven, and remained in
bed until the usual time of getting up next morning, being eight or
nine o’clock. In the course of my meetings with him, he and I had
arranged to get married, and at one time we had proposed September
last as the time and subsequently the present month of
March. It was proposed we should reside in furnished lodgings,
but we had not made any definite arrangement as to time or otherwise.
He was very unwell, and had gone to the Bridge of Allan
for his health, and he complained of sickness; but I have no idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
what was the cause of it. <i>I remember giving him some cocoa from
my window one night, some time ago, but I cannot specify the time
particularly. He took the cup in his hand and barely tasted it, and
I gave him no bread with it.</i> I was taking some cocoa myself at the
time, and had prepared it myself. (Identifies note No. 2, which
she wrote and sent to post.) <i>As I had attributed his illness to want
of food, I proposed, as stated in the note, to give him a loaf of bread,
but I said that merely in a joke, and in point of fact I never gave
him any bread.</i></p>

<p>I have bought arsenic on various occasions. The last I bought
was a sixpenny-worth, in Currie’s, the apothecary’s shop in Sauchiehall
Street. Prior to that I had bought other two quantities
of arsenic for which I paid sixpence each&mdash;one of these in Currie’s,
and the other in Murdoch’s, the apothecary’s shop in Sauchiehall
Street. I used it all as a cosmetic, and applied it to my face,
neck, and arms, diluted with water. The arsenic I got at Currie’s
on Wednesday, 18th March, and used it all on one occasion, having
put it all in the basin where I was to wash myself. I had been
advised to this use of arsenic by a young lady of the name of
Giubilei, the daughter of an actress, whom I had met at school at
Clapton near London.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> I had also seen it recommended in the
newspapers. I did not wish any of my father’s family to know that
I was using arsenic, and therefore never mentioned it to anyone,
and I do not suppose that they or any of the servants noticed it in
the basin. When I bought the arsenic at Murdoch’s, I am not
sure whether I was asked or not what it was for; but I think I
said for a gardener, to kill rats or destroy vermin about flowers, and
I only said this because I did not wish them to know that I was
going to use it as a cosmetic. I do not remember whether I was
asked as to the use I was going to make of the arsenic on the other
two occasions. I likely made the same statement about it as I had
done at Murdoch’s; and on all three occasions, as required in the
shops, I signed my name to a book in which the sales are entered.
On the first occasion I was accompanied by Mary, a daughter of
Dr. Buchanan, of Dumbarton. For several years past Mr. Minnoch,
of the firm of W. Houldsworth &amp; Co., has been coming a
good deal about my father’s house; and about a month ago he
made a proposal of marriage to me, and I gave him my hand in
token of acceptance, but no time for the marriage has been fixed;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and my object in writing the note, No. 1, before mentioned, was to
have a meeting with Mr. L’Angelier to tell him I was engaged to
Mr. Minnoch.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> (Identifies two notes and an envelope bearing the
Glasgow post-mark of 23rd January, as written and sent by her to
L’Angelier.) On the occasion that I gave L’Angelier the cocoa, I
think that I used it must have been known to the servants and
members of my father’s family, as the package containing the
cocoa was lying on the mantelpiece in my room, but no one of the
family used it, as they did not like it. The water that I used I
got hot from the servants. On the night of the 18th, when I used
the arsenic last, I was going to a dinner party at Mr. Minnoch’s
house. I never administered, or caused to be administered, to Mr.
L’Angelier arsenic or anything injurious. And this I declare to
be truth.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">With this brief introduction, let us proceed to the details
of his various illnesses, due, as the prosecution inferred, to
arsenical poisoning.</p>


<p class="psh">THE SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins, at whose house L’Angelier came to lodge in
the July of 1856, and continued there till his death, spoke
of her lodger as of civil habits, but wont to stay out at night,
for which purpose he had the use of a latch-key. His health
was usually good; but about the middle of February, 1857,
he had a severe attack of illness, and another on the 23rd,
of which she gave the following account:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“One night he wished a pass key, as he thought he would be
late out. I went to bed and did not hear him come in. I knocked
at his door about eight the next morning and got no answer. I
knocked again, and he said, ‘Come in, if you please.’ I went in.
He said, ‘I have been very unwell; look what I have vomited.’ I
said I thought it was bile. It was a greenish substance. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was a great deal of it. It was thick stuff, like gruel. I said, ‘Why
did you not call me?’ He said that while on the road coming
home, he was seized with a violent pain in his bowels and stomach,
and when he was taking off his clothes, thought he should have
died on the carpet, and no human eye would have seen him. ‘I
was not able,’ he said, ‘to ring the bell.’ He asked me to make a
little tea, and said he would not go out. I emptied what he had
vomited, and advised him to go to a doctor, and he said he would.
He took a little breakfast and then went to sleep for an hour, when
I went back to him, and he said he was better, and would go out.
Mr. Thuau, who lodges in my house, saw him. He went out between
ten and eleven&mdash;his place of business is two streets off. He returned
about three in the afternoon, said he had been to a doctor
and brought a bottle of medicine with him. He took the medicine
and complained about feeling very thirsty.</p>

<p>“His illness made a great change in his appearance. He looked
yellow and dull, and before that his complexion was fresh. He
became dark under the eyes, and the red of his cheeks seemed to
be more broken. He complained of being very cold after he came
in. He lay down on the sofa, and I laid a railway-rug over him.
I did nothing for his feet. He never was the same after his illness.
When asked how he felt, he was accustomed to say, ‘I never feel
well.’ On a Monday morning, about four o’clock, he called me.
He was vomiting. It was the same kind of stuff as before in colour
and otherwise. There was not quite so much of it. He complained
on this occasion likewise of pain in the bowels and stomach, and of
thirst and cold. I did not know he was out the night before. He
did not say anything about it. I put more blankets on him, jars
of hot water to his feet, and made him some tea. I gave him also
a great many drinks&mdash;toast and water, lemon and water, and such
like&mdash;because he was thirsty. I called again about six in the
morning. He did not rise until the forenoon. Dr. Thomson came
to attend, fetched by Thuau, and left a prescription for powders, of
which he took one or two. He said they were not doing him the
good he expected; ‘the doctor always said he was getting better,
but he did not feel well;’ ‘he did not feel getting better.’ He was
eight days away from business at that time. Some time after he
went to Edinburgh, and returned to Glasgow on the 17th of March,
and stayed till the 19th, when he went away, as he said, to the
Bridge of Allan.</p>

<p>“He went away about 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and said he would not be home
before Wednesday night or Thursday morning next week. A letter
came for him on the 19th like those that used to come, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
gave it to Thuau. I don’t remember any coming on Friday, but
one more, like a lady’s writing, on Saturday, which I also gave to
Thuau. (Identifies envelope as like that of letter received on
Saturday, but not another which was shown her.) L’Angelier was
much disappointed at not getting a letter before he left, and said,
‘If I get a letter, perhaps I shall be home to-night.’</p>

<p>“I next saw L’Angelier on Sunday night, about eight. He said
the letter sent had brought him home. I told him it had come on
Saturday afternoon. He did not say where he had come from. I
understood he had been at the Bridge of Allan. He looked much
better, and said he was so. He went out about 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and asked for
a latch-key, as he might be late. I was to call him early. It was
about half-past two next morning when I next saw him; he did
not use the latch-key, but rang the bell violently. When I opened
the door, he was standing with his arms on his stomach. He said,
‘I am very bad. I am going to have another vomiting of that
bile.’ The first time I saw the vomitings, I said it was bile. He
said he was never troubled with bile. He said he never thought
he should have got home, he was so bad on the road. He did not
say how he had been bad. The first thing he took was a little
water. I filled up the tumbler, and he tried to vomit. He wished
a little tea. I went into the room (with it?), and before he was
half undressed he was vomiting severely. It was the same kind
of matter as I had seen before. There was a light. The vomiting
was attended with great pain. I asked him whether he had taken
anything to disagree with his stomach. He said he had taken
nothing since he was at the Bridge of Allan. He was chill and
cold, and wished a jar of hot water to his feet, and another to his
stomach. I got these for him, and two blankets and mats. He
got a little easier. About four o’clock he was worse, and on my
proposing to go for a doctor said he was a little better, and I need
not. About five he was worse again, and his bowels became bad.
He had been vomiting only up to this time. I went for Dr.
Steven, who could not come so early, but told me to give him
twenty-five drops of laudanum, and put a mustard blister on his
stomach, and if he did not get better he would come. At L’Angelier’s
request, I went again, and the doctor came, who immediately
ordered him mustard. I said to him, ‘Look at what he
has vomited.’ He said, ‘Take it away, it is making him faint.’ I
got the mustard, and the doctor put it on, and I think gave him a
little morphia. I said to L’Angelier, ‘This is the worst attack you
have had.’ The doctor stayed about a quarter of an hour or
twenty minutes. I took him into the dining-room, and asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
what was wrong; he asked me if he was a person that tippled. I
said, ‘No,’ and that this was the second time this had occurred,
and asked what was the reason. The doctor said this was matter
for explanation. The first time I went back, L’Angelier asked
what the doctor had said. I said he thought he would get over it,
and L’Angelier replied, ‘I am far worse than he thinks.’ About
nine, when I drew the curtains, he looked very ill, and I asked if
there was no one he wished sent for. He asked to see Miss Perry,
of Bamfield Street. I sent for her. He said he thought that if
he could get five minutes’ sleep he should be better. These were
the last words I heard him use. I went back into the room in
about five minutes; he was then quite quiet, and I thought he was
asleep. The doctor then returned, and I told him so. He went
into the room, felt his pulse, lifted his head, and said he was dead.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Nothing of importance with reference to the symptoms of
his attacks was elicited in cross-examination. His first illness,
according to the witness, was a great deal worse than
the second. It was in January that he first complained of
ill health. He then first complained of his tongue; then a
boil came out on his neck, and shortly after another. She
did not think that he ate what suited him, and especially too
many vegetables, to which he said he was accustomed in
France. On the morning of his death he complained about
his mouth being sore. The doctor gave him some water,
and he said it was choking him, or that it was going
into his chest. When in bed that morning he always had
his arms out on the bed clothes. She did not remember his
hands being clenched. His right hand was clenched when
he died. The remainder of the cross-examination related to
the dress he usually wore, and the search by the officers for
his papers.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Thomson</i>, a physician in Glasgow, who had known
L’Angelier for two years, gave the following evidence as to his
health up to about the 10th of March:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“He consulted me professionally, the first time, fully a year ago,
when he had a bowel complaint, of which he got better. Next
time was on the 3rd February this year for a cold and cough, and
boil on his neck, for which I prescribed. The next week after I
saw him, when another boil had appeared. <i>On the 23rd of February</i>
he came to me. He was very feverish, and his tongue was furred,
and had a patchy appearance, from the fur being off in various
places. He complained of nausea, and had been vomiting. He
was prostrate, his pulse was quick, and he had general symptoms
of fever. I prescribed for him (taking his complaint to be bilious
derangement) an aperient draught. He had been ill, I think, for
a day or two, but he had been taken worse the night before he
called on me&mdash;during the night of the 22nd and the morning of
the 23rd. He was confined to the house for two or three days. I
visited him on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of February, and on the
1st of March met him. The aperient draught I prescribed contained
magnesia and soda. On the 24th I prescribed powders
containing rhubarb, soda, chalk of camomile, and ipecacuanha.
On the 24th he was much in the same state. He had vomited
the draught I had given him on the 23rd, and I observed that his
skin was considerably jaundiced; and from the whole symptoms I
called the disease a bilious fever. On the 25th he was rather
better, and had risen from his bed to the sofa, but was not dressed.
On the 26th he felt considerably better and cooler, and I did not
think it necessary to repeat my visits till I happened to be in the
neighbourhood. <i>It did not occur to me that these symptoms arose
from the action of any irritant poison. If I had known that he had
taken an irritant poison, these were the symptoms I should expect to
follow.</i> I don’t think I asked him when he was seriously taken ill.
I had not seen him for some little time before, and certainly he
looked very dejected and ill; <i>his colour was rather darker and
jaundiced, and round the eye the colour was rather darker than
usual</i>. I saw him again eight or ten days after the 1st of March.
He called on me, but I have no note of the day; he was much the
same as on the 1st of March. He said he was thinking of going
into the country, but did not say where. I did not prescribe for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
him then. On the 26th of February, I think I told him to give
up smoking. I thought it was injurious to his stomach. I never
saw him again in life.”</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 23rd of March, Mr. Stevenson and
Mr. Thuau called on me, mentioned his death, and wished me to
go and see his body, and see if I could give an opinion as to the
cause of his death. They did not know that I had not seen him
alive in his last illness. I went to the house. The body was laid
out on a stretcher on the table. <i>The skin had a slightly jaundiced
hue.</i> I said it was impossible to give a decided opinion, and
requested Dr. Steven to be sent for, who had been in attendance.
I examined the body with my hands externally, and over the
region of the liver the sound was dull; and over the region of the
heart the sound was natural. I saw what he had vomited, and
made inquiry as to the symptoms before death. Dr. Steven, when
he arrived, corroborated the statements of the landlady, as far as
he was concerned. No resolution as to a <i>post-mortem</i> examination
was come to that day, but in the afternoon I stated to Mr. Huggins
and another gentleman, who called on me, that the symptoms
were such as might have been produced by an irritant poison, and
that it was such a case that, had it occurred in England, a coroner’s
inquest would be held.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, the witness said&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<i>At the time I attended L’Angelier, in February, there were no
symptoms that I could definitely say were not due to a bilious attack,
they were all the symptoms of such an attack. There was no appearance
of jaundice. I have heard of that as a symptom of irritant poison.</i>
It is in Dr. Taylor’s work on poisons. <i>The jaundice I saw was
quite consistent that he was labouring under a bilious attack, and
could easily be accounted for that way.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Steven</i>, physician of Glasgow, who was called in by
Mrs. Jenkins on the 23rd of March, at the commencement
of the fatal attack, carried on the case to the death of the
deceased:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I was applied to,” said the Witness, “early in the morning of
the 23rd of March last, by Mrs. Jenkins, to see her lodger, who
she told me was suffering from a severe bilious attack. Being unwell
myself I was unwilling to go, but advised her to give him hot
water and drops of laudanum. She came to me again about seven.
I went, thinking, as he was a Frenchman, he might not be understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
I found him in bed, very much depressed. His features
were pinched, and his hands. He complained of coldness and pain
over the region of the stomach. By pinched, I mean shrunk and
cold, or inclined to become cold. He complained of general chilliness
and his face and hands were cold to the touch. He was
physically and mentally depressed. I spoke to him and observed
nothing peculiar in his voice. I did not expect a strong voice, and
it was not particularly weak. That was when I first entered the
room. But his voice became weaker. He complained that his
breathing was painful, but it did not seem hurried. I dissuaded
him from speaking, had extra clothes put on his bed, gave him a
little morphia (mustard?) to make him vomit, but he seemed to have
vomited all he could. He had a weak pulse. I felt the action of the
heart corresponding to it. That imported that the circulation was
weaker at the extremities. The feet were not cold. Hot bottles
were put to them, and also above his body for his hands. He was
not urgently complaining of thirst. He seemed afraid of drinking
large quantities for fear of making himself vomit. He asked particularly
for cold water, and was unwilling to take whisky, which
the landlady talked of giving him. He said he had been vomiting
and purging. I saw a utensil filled with the matter vomited and
purged. I ordered it to be removed and a clean one put in its
place, that I might see what he had vomited. I did not see it. I
believe it was kept for some time, but I said it might be thrown
away: that was after his death. He said, ‘<i>This is third attack</i> I
have had: the landlady says it is bile, but I never was subject to
bile.’ He seemed to get worse while I was there. He several
times said, ‘My poor mother,’ and how dull he felt at being so ill
away from friends. I applied a mustard poultice to his stomach.
I stayed I suppose half-an-hour. I called again about a quarter
past eleven. The landlady met me and said he had been quite as
bad as in the morning. I went into the room and found him dead.
He was lying on his right side, with his back towards the light, his
knees drawn a little up, one arm outside the bedclothes and the other
in. They were not much&mdash;not unnaturally drawn up. He seemed
in a comfortable position, as if sleeping. About mid-day I was
sent for again; Dr. Thomson was there when I went in. I asked
him if there was anything in his previous illness, with the symptoms
I mentioned, which would account for the cause of death, but
we were entirely at a loss to account for it. I declined giving a
certificate unless I made an examination, and Dr. Thomson and I
made one the next day. We subsequently made a second examination
after the body was exhumed.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The witness then described how the stomach and its
contents were carefully preserved and sent to Professor Penny
for analysis (see <a name="see_a" id="see_a">Appendix A.</a>, p. <a href="#app_a">355</a>).</p>

<p class="psh">ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Penny</i>, the Professor of Chemistry in the Andersonian
University, Glasgow, then read the following report of his
analysis of the parts of the body handed to him by
Dr. Thomson, made at the request of one of the procurators
fiscal of the country.</p>

<p class="pc1">(1.) <i>Contents of Stomach.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“The liquid measured 8½ ounces. On being allowed to repose,
it deposited a white powder, which was found on examination to
possess the external characters and all the chemical properties
peculiar to arsenious acid, that is, the common white arsenic of the
shops. It consisted of hard, gritty, transparent, colourless crystalline
particles; it was soluble in boiling water, and readily dissolved
in a solution of caustic potash. It was unchanged by
sulphide of ammonium, and volatised when heated on platina foil.
Heated in a tube it gave a sparkling white sublimate, which,
under the microscope, was found to consist of octahedral crystals.
Its aqueous solution afforded, with ammonio-nitrate of silver,
ammonio-sulphate of copper, sulphuretted hydrogen, and bichromate
of potash, the highly characteristic results produced by
arsenious acid. On heating a small portion of it in a small tube
with black flux, a brilliant ring of metallic arsenic was obtained,
with all its distinctive properties. Heated with dilute hydrochloric
acid and a slip of copper foil, a steel-gray coating was deposited on
the copper; and this coating, by further examination, was proved to
be metallic arsenic.</p>

<p>“Another portion of the powder, on being heated with nitric acid,
yielded a substance having the peculiar characters of arsenic
acid. A small portion of the powder was also subjected to what
is commonly known as ‘Marsh’s Proof,’ and metallic arsenic was
thus obtained, with all its peculiar physical and chemical properties.
These results show, unequivocally, that the said white
powder was arsenious acid&mdash;that is the preparation of arsenic which
is usually sold in commerce, and administered, or taken as a poison,
under the name of arsenic or oxide of arsenic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“I then examined <i>the fluid contents of the stomach</i>. After the
usual preparatory operations, it was subjected to the following
processes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“(1.) To a portion of the fluid Reinsch’s process was applied, and
an abundant steel-like coating was obtained on copper foil. On
heating the coated copper in a glass tube, the peculiar odour of
arsenic was distinctly perceptible, and a white crystalline sublimate
was produced, possessing the properties peculiar to arsenious
acid.</p>

<p>“(2.) Another portion was distilled, and the distillate subjected
to Marsh’s process. The gas produced by this process had an
arsenical odour, burned with a bluish-white flame, and gave with
nitrate of silver the characteristic reaction of arseniuretted hydrogen.
On holding above the flame a slip of bibulous paper moistened with
a solution of ammonio-nitrate of silver, a yellow colour was communicated
to the paper. A white porcelain capsule depressed
upon the flame was quickly covered with brilliant stains, which on
being tested with the appropriate reagents, were found to be
metallic arsenic. By a modification of Marsh’s apparatus, the
gas was conducted through a heated tube, when a lustrous mirror-like
deposit of arsenic in the metallic state was collected; and this
deposit was afterwards converted into arsenious acid.</p>

<p>“(3.) Through another portion of the fluid a stream of sulphuretted
hydrogen was transmitted, when a bright yellow precipitate
separated, having the chemical properties of trisulphide of arsenic.
It dissolved readily in ammonia; it remained unchanged in hydrochloric
acid; and it gave, on being heated with black flux, a brilliant
ring of metallic arsenic.</p>

<p>“(4.) A fourth portion, being properly acidified with hydrochloric
acid was distilled, and the distillate subjected to ‘Fleitmann’s’
process. For this purpose it was boiled with zinc and a strong
solution of caustic potash. Arseniuretted hydrogen was disengaged
and was recognised by its odour, and its characteristic action on
nitrate of silver.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">(2.) <i>Stomach.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“I examined, in the next place, the stomach itself. It was cut
into small pieces, and boiled for some time in water containing
hydrochloric acid, and the solution, after being filtered, was subjected
to the same processes as those applied to the contents of
the stomach. The results in every case were precisely similar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and the presence of a considerable quantity of arsenic was unequivocally
detected.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">(3.) <i>Quantity of Arsenic.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I made, in the last place, a careful determination of the quantity
of arsenic contained in the stomach and its contents. A
stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gas was transmitted through a
known quantity of the prepared fluid from the said matters, until
the whole of the arsenic was precipitated in the form of trisulphide
of arsenic. This sulphide, after being carefully purified, was collected,
dried, and weighed, and the weight corresponded to a
quantity of arsenious acid (common white arsenic) in the entire
stomach and its contents equal to 82 grains and seven-tenths of a
grain, or nearly one-fifth of an ounce. The accuracy of this result
was confirmed by converting the sulphide of arsenic into arseniate
of ammonia and magnesia, and weighing the product. <i>The quantity
here stated is exclusive of the white powder first examined.</i> The
purity of the various materials and reagents employed in this
investigation was most scrupulously ascertained.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Conclusions.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“Having considered the results of this investigation, I am
clearly of opinion that they are conclusive in showing (1), That
the matters subjected to examination and analysis contained
arsenic, and (2), That the quantity of arsenic found was considerably
more than sufficient to destroy life.</p>

<p>“All this is true, on soul and conscience.</p>

<p class="pr8">“<span class="smcap">Frederick Penny</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<i>Professor of Chemistry</i>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>April 6, 1857.</i></p>

<p><i>Examination resumed.</i>&mdash;“It is not easy to give a precise answer
to the question ‘How much arsenic would destroy life?’ Cases
are on record in which life was destroyed by two and four grains;
four or six grains are generally sufficient to destroy life, and the
amount I determined as existing in the stomach was 82 grains.
On the 31st of March I attended the exhumation of M. L’Angelier’s
body. I saw the coffin opened, and the portions of the body removed,
which were carefully preserved, in jars of which I never
lost sight, and I analysed the contents, and prepared the following</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Report.</i></p>

<p>“On Tuesday, 31st March last, I was present at a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination of the body of P. E. L’Angelier, made by Drs. Corbet,
Thomson, and Steven, in a vault in the Ramshorn Church,
Glasgow.</p>

<p>“At my request, portions of the following organs were removed
from the body, and properly preserved for chemical analysis and
examination: (1.) Small intestine and contents; (2.) Large intestine;
(3.) Liver; (4.) Heart; (5.) Lung; (6.) Brain. These
articles were taken direct to the Laboratory of the Andersonian
Institution, and were there delivered to me by the parties
named. I have since made a careful analysis and chemical examination
of all the said matters, with the following results:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">(1.) <i>Small Intestine and Contents.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“The portion of the small intestine contained a turbid and
reddish-coloured fluid, measuring four ounces. On standing for
several hours in a glass vessel, this liquid deposited numerous and
well-defined octahedral crystals, which, being subjected to the
usual chemical processes for the detection of arsenic, were found
to be arsenious acid. Arsenic was also detected in the small
intestine.</p>

<p class="pc1">(2.) <i>Large Intestine.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“This organ yielded arsenic, but in less proportion than in the
small intestine.</p>

<p class="pc1">(3.) <i>Liver, Brain, and Heart.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Arsenic was separated from the liver, brain, and heart, but in
much less proportion than from the small and large intestines.</p>

<p class="pc1">(4.) <i>Lung.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“The lung gave only a slight indication of the presence of
arsenic.</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Conclusions.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“(1.) That the body of the deceased contained arsenic.</p>

<p>“(2.) That the arsenic must have been taken by or administered
to him while living.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>The witness then spoke of the examinations he had made
into the arsenic sold by the two chemists, <i>Murdoch</i> and
<i>Currie</i>, at whose shops the prisoner had stated she had
purchased it, for the purposes of a cosmetic. In that sold
at <i>Murdoch’s</i>, 91·1 per cent. was pure white arsenic, and in
that from <i>Currie’s</i>, 94·4 per cent., and the remainder inorganic
matter; in <i>Murdoch’s</i> carbonaceous, in <i>Currie’s</i> indigo and
carbonaceous matter. The quantity of indigo in this arsenic
was extremely small, and capable of being removed by peculiar
and dexterous manipulation, so that the arsenic would appear
white to the unassisted eye. If of this an amount sufficient
to cause death had been given, and prior to death great
vomiting had taken place, the witness would not expect to
find any portion of the indigo: the quantity was so small,
that it would not colour wine of any sort. In the case of
<i>Murdoch’s</i> arsenic, however, as it was mixed with carbonaceous
particles, if that had been given and settled down
from the contents of the stomach as in this case, he should
have expected to find such particles&mdash;not, however, if it had
been given a month before. Of the twelve bottles and two
packages of medicines, and the cake of chocolate found at
L’Angelier’s lodging, and submitted to him for analysis,
none, except a weak solution of aconite were poisonous, and
that was so weak, that had the whole two ounces in the
phial been swallowed, it would not have destroyed life. Of
the use of prussic acid or arsenic as a cosmetic he had never
heard, and believed that both would be dangerous, and the
latter might produce constitutional symptoms of poisoning.
He had heard of its use as a depilatory, but then mixed with
other matters, as lime, and it was not arsenious acid, but
usually the yellow sulphide, that was used for this purpose.</p>

<p>On <i>cross-examination by the Dean of Faculty</i>, the witness
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In the entire stomach and its contents there was arsenic equal
to 82, 7-10th grains, exclusive of the white powder first examined,
which, after being dried, weighed 5, 2-10th grains, and was
arsenious acid. I did not determine the quantity of arsenic in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the liver, heart, or brain, and can give no notion of the quantity
that might be in those organs. In the small intestine it must
have been considerable, because when its contents were allowed to
repose arsenious acid crystallised out of that liquid and deposited
abundantly on the sides of the vessel,&mdash;which indicated that the
liquid had as much arsenic as it could hold in solution at that
temperature. I can’t give any idea of the quantity in the small
intestine. It was decidedly appreciable. It would be a mere
matter of guess, and I should not like to guess in so serious a
matter. If the deceased, when attacked by symptoms of arsenical
poisoning, vomited often, and in large quantities, it would depend
on the mode of administration whether a quantity would be carried
off. If given in solid food, and in a solid state, a large portion of
the arsenic would be ejected from the stomach if all the food were
vomited; but if the arsenic were stirred up with the liquid, and
thereby thrown into a state of mechanical suspension, I should not
expect that so considerable a portion would be ejected by vomiting.
By solid food I mean bread and the like. In the case of the
arsenic being taken in a fluid, I could not say what proportion
might be ejected. I should not be surprised to find that as much
had been ejected as retained. Judging from what I found in the
body, the dose must have been of a very unusual size. There are
cases on record in which large quantities of arsenic have been
found in the stomach and intestines&mdash;larger than in the present.
I think there is a case where two drachms&mdash;120 grains&mdash;were
found. In the cases I refer to the arsenic was taken voluntarily,
with the intention to commit suicide. It would be very difficult
to give a large dose in a liquid. By a large dose you exclude
many vehicles in which arsenic might be administered. Nothing
which I found indicated the time when the arsenic must have been
taken. The ordinary period between the administration of the
poison and the symptoms being manifested is eight to ten hours in
the cases on record: that is the extreme time. There are some
cases in which they show themselves in half an hour. We have
cases in which death resulted in a few hours, and cases in which
death has been delayed two days. As to the arsenic bought at
<i>Currie’s</i> shop, the greater part of the colouring matter might be
removed. If you were to throw water on the arsenic, and agitate
the two together, and after the arsenic has subsided you throw off
the liquor, a portion of the colouring matter is thrown off, and if
you keep the vessel shaken in a particular way you may coax the
greater part of the colouring matter away. <i>Murdoch’s</i> arsenic was
coloured with carbonaceous matter&mdash;it had the colour of coal soot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
I cannot tell from examination whether the arsenic found was
given in one dose or in several. It would be very dangerous to
use arsenic externally in any way. There are cases in which it
has been rubbed on the whole skin, and the symptoms of poisoning
produced&mdash;vomiting, pain, but not death. My impression is, from
general reading, that it produces eruption on the sound skin.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> If
cold water were used, I should not like to wash in it. I cannot
give any other answer.”</p>

<p><i>To the Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“There are cases in which inflammation
of the intestines has been produced by the external application
of arsenic.”</p>

<p><i>To the Dean.</i>&mdash;“Arsenic is an irritant poison; it is absorbed into
the blood, I presume, with great rapidity, and through the blood it
reaches all the organs in which we find it.”</p>

<p><i>To the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“In administering large doses of arsenic
many vehicles are excluded. Cocoa or chocolate is a vehicle in
which a large dose might be given. There is a great difference
between giving rise to suspicion and actual detection. I have
found by actual experiment, that when 30 to 40 grains of arsenic
are put into a cup of warm chocolate, a large portion of the arsenic
settles down in the bottom of the cup, and I think a person drinking
such poisonous chocolate would suspect something when the
gritty particles came into his mouth; but when the same and even
a larger quantity were boiled with the chocolate, instead of being
stirred or mixed, none of it settles down.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> I could not separate the
soot from <i>Murdoch’s</i> arsenic, but a very large quantity of it might
be separated. Supposing a person subjected to repeated doses of
arsenic, I have no evidence on which to form an opinion whether
the last dose would be more rapidly fatal.”</p>

<p><i>To the Dean.</i>&mdash;“In the case of chocolate being boiled with arsenic
in it, a larger portion dissolves and does not subside. That is what
I find by actual experiment. Coffee or tea could not be made the
vehicle of so large a dose of arsenic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To the Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“The period in which the arsenic produces
its effect varies in different individuals, and according to the
mode of administration. Pain in the stomach is one of the first
symptoms, and vomiting usually accompanies the pain, but it may
be very severe before the vomiting actually begins. Ten, fifteen,
or twenty grains might be given in coffee.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Professor Penny</i>, subsequently (on the fourth day), gave
the following account of experiments made by him with
arsenic purchased from <i>Murdoch’s</i> and <i>Currie’s</i> shops:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Some of the arsenic I purchased from <i>Murdoch’s</i>, which was
mixed with soot, I gave to a dog, and I had no difficulty in detecting
the soot in the stomach of that dog after death. I administered
arsenic, coloured by myself with indigo, to another dog, and had no
difficulty in detecting the indigo in that case by chemical tests.
To another dog I administered arsenic purchased at <i>Currie’s</i>, which
it will be remembered was mixed with indigo. After death I
detected black particles in the stomach of that dog, but I could
not undertake to identify the arsenic found with the arsenic given:
I mean I found carbonaceous particles, but that I could not
undertake to say that these particles were of themselves sufficient
to identify any of the particular poison administered. But as I
administered it myself, it must have been the same&mdash;at least, I
know of no other source. I could detect no arsenic in the brains
of the dogs. I found solid arsenic in the stomach, as well as in the
texture of the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“Is it the fact that there is less arsenic found in
the brains of animals than of human beings?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I am not aware. In the one case I detected blue
colouring matter of indigo, in the other carbonaceous particles.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p><i>By the Dean.</i>&mdash;“Did you make yourself acquainted with the
nature of the colouring matter of <i>Currie’s</i> arsenic before administering
it to the dog?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I did.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Did the black particles you found correspond to
the constituents of the colouring matter?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“They have a close resemblance to them, both in
physical appearance and in chemical properties.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Were they not in physical appearance and chemical
properties, identical?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“They were.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Professor Christison</i>, to whom, on the 11th of May,
Dr. Penny had delivered similar portions of the body to those
on which he had experimented, together with portions of
the deposits from the stomach and intestines, made a
chemical analysis of the white powder, and the fluids obtained
from the stomach, and the small intestine, and of a portion
of the liver. As from these he obtained unequivocal proofs
of the presence of arsenic, he did not, at that time, proceed
further. Subsequently, however, on the 28th of May, he
analysed a portion of the great intestine, and was satisfied of
the presence of arsenic; and in a portion of the brain he
found “traces of arsenic, but not satisfactory evidence, which
might be owing to the small quantity of material he had to
analyse.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The fluid from the stomach,” he said, “appeared to indicate
a considerable quantity in the system&mdash;more than sufficient to
destroy life. The symptoms of arsenic poisoning are variable.
Sometimes they pass off quickly, sometimes continue for weeks or
months. When they continue, they are indigestion, loss of strength,
emaciation, sometimes diarrhœa, lassitude of the limbs. If there
appeared erosions with elevated edges in the intestines, I should
have been led to suspect the existence of some affection of the
intestines previous to the final attack. The appearances exhibited
by the <i>post-mortem</i> examination were such as the witness would
expect from arsenic.”</p>

<p><i>By the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“If you had been consulted in a case of
this kind,&mdash;that on the 18th or 19th of February a person having
gone out in good health returns, is attacked during the night with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
great pain in the bowels, severe vomiting of a green viscous fluid,
accompanied by intense thirst and purging, and after the lapse of
two or three days and partial recovery the patient is again seized
with the same symptoms, though in a somewhat modified form,
and that after the second attack he had continued affected with
great lassitude, change of colour, low pulse, and that after going
from home for ten or fourteen days, had again returned and been
attacked the same night with those symptoms in an aggravated
form, and had died within eight or ten hours of his return, and
that on a <i>post-mortem</i> examination the results were found of which
you are aware in this case:&mdash;I wish you to give me your opinion,
as a man of science and skill, what conclusion you would draw as
to the cause of the previous illness and death?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I could have no doubt that the cause of death was
poisoning by arsenic, and such being the case, I should have entertained
a strong suspicion in regard to his previous illness, because
his death would have prevented me from taking the means of
satisfying my mind on the subject by a careful examination of all
the circumstances.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Are the symptoms consistent with what
you would expect if continuous poisoning was taking place?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“They are those which have occurred in parallel cases
of the administration of doses singly insufficient to cause
death.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Of the samples of <i>Murdoch’s</i> and <i>Currie’s</i> arsenic, which
Dr. Penny had delivered to him, “The former,” he said,
“contained the due proportion of soot; the latter was not
coloured with the indigo prescribed by the Act&mdash;was not of
a bluish, but greyish black colour, imperfectly mixed, and
easily removeable by washing with cold water, which cannot
easily be done with good indigo. The proportion
was a thirty-sixth, and not a thirty-second, as the Act
directs.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness was first directed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the probability of the colouring matter in the arsenic being
detected in the portions of the body analysed.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My attention,” said Professor Christison, “was not directed to
colouring matter in arsenic. I got only one article in which it
might have been found&mdash;the small intestine. The others had been
subjected to a previous analysis. I was not asked to attend to
the colouring matter. I did not see it, and did not search for it.
Supposing soot or indigo to have been given with the arsenic, I
think it might have been found in the intestines by careful examination.
I can’t say it would have been found: many circumstances
go to the possibility of its being found. Many component parts of
soot are insoluble: it might have been removed by frequent vomiting.
It is very difficult to remove soot from arsenic entirely.
Indigo would have been found more easily from the peculiarity of
its colour, and the chemical ingredients are so precise. <i>Currie’s</i>
arsenic is not coloured with true indigo; it is waste indigo, or
what has been used by the dyer. I don’t know how it is prepared.
I did not analyse the colouring matter of <i>Currie’s</i> arsenic. I
ascertained it was not the indigo directed by the Act to be
used, and I ascertained the quantity. I separated the colouring
matter from the arsenic, and subjected it to the action of
sulphuric acid. Charcoal (more properly&mdash;<i>carbon</i>) is one of the
constituents of good indigo, and necessarily of waste. The chief
constituent of soot is charcoal also.”</p>

<p class="p1">The remainder of his <i>cross-examination</i> was directed to the
amount of arsenic found in the stomach, and the symptoms of,
and the period at which the effects are exhibited.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I was informed by Dr. Penny that he had found more than
eighty grains in the stomach. There was also the white powder in
addition. If there was great vomiting and purging, the quantity
of arsenic administered must have been much greater than that
found in the stomach and intestines. Much would depend whether
means were taken to promote vomiting. If hot and cold water
were freely given, that would facilitate the discharge of the poison.
It is impossible to say the proportion ejected. I think it would be
reasonable to suppose that as much would be vomited as remained:
it might, without any extravagant supposition, be taken at four or
five times as much.” <i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;“There was nothing in the
symptoms mentioned in the last illness in this case inconsistent
with death being produced by a single dose of arsenic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
ordinary symptoms of this kind are not unlike those of malignant
cholera. <i>I think all the symptoms in this case might have occurred
from malignant cholera. If there was a sense of choking and soreness
of the throat, I think these are more symptoms of arsenic.</i> I don’t
think they have occurred in cholera. I think the ulcers in the
abdomen might indicate the previous existence of inflammation in
the duodenum, called duodenitis. It might be a disease that
would present the outward symptoms of bowel complaint or
cholera.” <i>Appearance of effects of arsenic.</i>&mdash;“The ordinary time
that elapses between the administration of arsenic and death is
from eighteen hours to two days and a half. The exceptions to
this are numerous. Some of them are very anomalous as to the
shortness of the intervals. The shortest are two and two-and-a-half
hours: these have been ascertained; but it is not always
possible to ascertain when it has been administered. I had a case
lately in which it was five hours. There are also cases in which
it was seven and even ten hours. It does not appear that the size
of the dose affects this; it does not depend upon the amount taken,
within certain bounds, of course; but I speak of the case as arsenic
is usually administered. There are a good many cases of large
doses. I think the dose in this case must have been double,
probably more than double, the quantity found in the stomach.
A dose of 220 grains may be considered a large dose. I can’t say
if, in cases of as large a dose as this, they are intentionally
administered: in great proportion of cases of suicide, the dose is
generally found to be large&mdash;easily accounted for by the desire to
make certain of death.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“In a case of murder no such large quantity would
be used? It is in cases of suicide that double-shotted pistols are
used and large doses given.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“But murder, even by injuries, and also by poison, is
very often detected by the size of the dose. In all cases of
poisoning by arsenic there is always more used than is necessary.
I cannot recollect how much has been used, but I know very well
that what is found in the stomach in undoubted cases of poisoning
by others has been considerably larger than what is necessary to
cause death: because the very fact of poison being found in the
stomach at all, as in the case of arsenic, shows that more has been
administered than is necessary, as it is not what is found in the
stomach causes death, but what disappears from the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“But do you know any case in which so great a
dose as the present was administered?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I cannot recollect at the present moment. In cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of charges of murder by arsenic it is scarcely possible to get any
information as to the actual quantity used.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“You have information here in this charge of
murder.”</p>

<p><i>The Witness.</i>&mdash;“You have information as to what was in the
stomach.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“And you are enabled to draw an inference.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Of course: my inference is drawn by a sort of probability,
but that is not an inference on which I am entitled to
found any positive statement.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Well, let me put this question. Did you ever
know any person murdered by arsenic having 88 grains of it found
in his stomach and intestines?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I don’t recollect at the present moment.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Or anything approaching to it?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I don’t recollect, but I would not rely on my recollection
as to a negative answer.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“You are not, at all events, able to give an example
the other way.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Not at present. As far as my own observation
goes, I can say that I never met with 80 grains in the stomach of
a person who had been poisoned by arsenic. I can’t say what is
the largest quantity I have found.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“If a person designs to poison another the use of
a large quantity of arsenic, greatly exceeding what is necessary, is
to be avoided?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It is a great error. In some articles of food it is
easy to administer a large quantity of arsenic, and in others it is
difficult to do so. It is very rare for persons to take meals after
arsenic has been administered; but there is a case of a girl who
took arsenic at eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and at two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> made a pretty good
dinner. It was a French case, and the words as translated are,
that she made a very good dinner, though it was observed she was
uneasy previously. The author who notices that case notices it
as a very extraordinary one. She died in thirteen or fourteen
hours after the administration. It was a rapid case.”</p>

<p><i>By the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“The amount of matter vomited is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
sometimes very little; and sometimes very large doses have been
thrown off by vomiting. There is one case in which half an ounce
was taken and no vomiting ensued. I think chocolate and cocoa
would be a vehicle in which a considerable dose might be given.
Active exercise would hasten the effect of arsenic; a long walk
would do so. Exercise accelerates the effects of all poisons except
narcotic. That a man should take poison at the Bridge of Allan,
come to Coatbridge, walk eight miles to Glasgow, and reach that
in good health and spirits, I should think very unlikely. Cases of
protraction for five hours have occurred in persons who had gone
to sleep after taking it. From half an hour to an hour is the
usual time between administration and the symptoms manifesting
themselves. The administration of previous doses predisposes the
system to the effects of poison, and makes its action more rapid
and violent. If the individual had recovered entirely, this would
not be so much the case; but if he still laboured under the derangement
of the stomach, I should look for violent effects.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On the fifth day Professor Christison was recalled, and gave
the following evidence as to the use of arsenic as a cosmetic,
its taste, and its supposed presence naturally in the bodies of
human beings.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>By the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“With regard to the use of arsenic as a
cosmetic, do you think it possible to use it, by putting it in a basin
of water and washing the face with it?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It would be very unsafe indeed. I should expect it
to produce inflammation, probably, of the eyes and nostrils, and
perhaps of the mouth. It might get into the mouth, and it would
be very difficult to keep it out of the eyes and nostrils; and if it
once got in, as it is a rather insoluble solid, it would be difficult to
wash it out. A preparation made from common arsenic is sometimes
used as a depilatory. The old name is ‘Arasma Cacoran,’
because it is used by the Turks. It is essentially a sulphuret of
arsenic and a sulphuret of lime. It is only used for removing
hairs from the skin, and not for the complexion.”</p>

<p><i>By the Dean.</i>&mdash;“The common arsenic of the shops, you say, is an
insoluble solid.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It is said in general terms to be so. <i>It is sparingly
soluble in cold water.</i> It is not absolutely insoluble, however, in
cold water. <i>About the 500th part might be dissolved in cold water
by violent agitation, and if the arsenic were to be boiled in the first
instance, about a 32nd part would remain in cold water. Cold water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
is the worst of all things to hold arsenic in suspension. Only the fine
parts of the powder would be held in suspension. The coarse arsenic
sold in the shops would fall to the bottom.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Suppose water were used to wash the face and
hands without drawing up the arsenic from the bottom, you would
not expect any serious consequences to result?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I can only say, that I should not like to do it myself.
I do not know absolutely what would follow; but, on
account of the risk, any person who would do so would do a very
imprudent thing.”</p>

<p><i>By the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Arsenic, though strictly heavier than
water, would remain in suspension?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The finer parts of the powder would, but not long.
I never made any experiment, but should say it would be for a
very short time. I should say, speaking on mere hazard, in the
course of three or four minutes there would be scarcely any of the
arsenic remaining in suspension, and there would only remain what
had dissolved. I am speaking, as I said, without having experimented.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“<i>Has arsenic any taste?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Your lordship is aware that there is a great deal of
dispute about that. After the strong affirmative of its having no
taste which I published, a greater authority than I&mdash;<i>Professor
Orfila of Paris&mdash;still adhered to the description that it had a taste.</i>
All I can say about that is, that experiments were made by myself
and two other medical gentlemen, as far as it was possible to make
them with so dangerous a substance, and we found the taste to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
very slight indeed; <i>if anything it was rather sweetish, but all but
imperceptible</i>.”</p>

<p><i>To the Court.</i>&mdash;“Then there can be no doubt that large quantities
of arsenic have been swallowed repeatedly by persons without
observing?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The experiments were made by myself and two other
medical gentlemen, and so far as we went we all agreed as to the
result. Professor Orfila maintained that it had a taste, though he
referred to my experiments. But I think I may add, that it
has struck me as very strange, that neither Orfila nor any others
who have doubted these observations of mine on the matter, said
that they had made any experiments themselves. Orfila does not
say so. He merely expresses his belief, notwithstanding what I
have stated.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“If taken in coffee or cream, then, the arsenic,
having, if any, a sweetish taste, would not be perceptible?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Not at all. I could put that in a clearer point of
view by a preliminary observation, namely, that several persons
who have taken arsenic largely without knowing at the time what
they were taking observed no taste; some observed a sweetish
taste, and others what they called an acrid taste. With regard to
acrimony, however, there were two fallacies. One was that they
confounded the acrimony with the roughness of taste in the
mouth, and secondly with the burning effects slowly developed by
the poison afterwards.”</p>

<p><i>By the Dean.</i>&mdash;“In these cases you have spoken of, in what
medium was the arsenic given?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Sometimes in simple vehicles, such as coffee and
water, and sometimes in thicker substances, such as soup. I think
there are some instances where some roughness was observed in
the case of porridge, but I cannot speak exactly as to the vehicles.
I do not think the vehicle had much effect on the different tastes.
I cannot state the quantity administered.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Are these cases in which you were personally
concerned?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Strange to say, I have only been personally concerned
in two cases of poisoning by arsenic. I have of course been
often in cases like the present. It only came twice under my
personal observation. It is the opinion of Orfila that the taste of
arsenic is an acrid and not a corrosive taste.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Exciting salivation, is it not?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes, that is a pretty correct translation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
French word. The word acrid is a professional word, but Orfila
uses the word <i>âpre</i>, which rather means rough.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Yes, in his 1st vol., p. 377, he uses the word, but
at p. 357 you will find he says the taste is <i>âcre et corrosive</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I was not aware of that. ‘Notwithstanding the
experiments of Dr. Christison,’ I think he says, ‘the taste of
arsenic is acrid.’ He did not say he made the experiments himself,
or give his authority. Orfila is a high name in the medical
world; none higher of modern date in the department of medico-legal
chemistry.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Will you tell me the nature of the experiments
you made with the two other medical gentlemen?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“We tasted the arsenic both in a solid and a liquid
state, and allowed both kinds to pass as far back along the tongue
as it was possible to do with safety, so as to spit it out afterwards.
We allowed it to remain on the tongue about two minutes, and
washed the mouth carefully.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Can you give me any idea how much arsenic there
was in your mouth on that occasion?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“About two grains. One of the gentlemen, the late
Dr. Duncan, kept two grains in his mouth a long time. We
allowed it to remain on the tongue generally two minutes, a time
quite sufficient to ascertain the taste.”</p>

<p><i>By the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Is it a common thing in cases of this
sort to ascertain the quantity of arsenic?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No. In the great majority of criminal cases it is
not ascertained within presumption.”</p>

<p><i>By the Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“Are you aware that a great chemist
maintained that there was arsenic naturally in the bodies of all
human beings?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I have heard that; but he afterwards surrendered
his opinion.”</p>

<p><i>By the Dean.</i>&mdash;“There has been a great shifting of opinion
among medical men as to the probable effect of arsenic, has there
not?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Not during the last 35 years. Prior to that our
information as to the effects of arsenic was very vague.”</p>

<p><i>By the Dean.</i>&mdash;“Was it not generally thought at one time that
there was naturally arsenic in the human stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It may be so, but it is quite new to me.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Robert Telfer Corbett</i>, physician in Glasgow, and senior
surgeon in the infirmary, who had assisted at the <i>post-mortem</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
examination and joined in the report, was called on the fourth
day, and gave the following evidence.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“So far as he could judge without analysis the deceased had
died from the effect of poison. The morbid appearances presented
were of two kinds&mdash;one showing the result of recent action, the
other of action at a period antecedent to it. The last of these appearances
consisted of several ulcers, each about the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16th</sub> of an
inch in diameter, with elevated edge, on the upper part of the
duodenum. They might have been characteristic of the effect
of irritant poison at the distance of a month, but it is impossible
to fix any date. I think they were such as irritant poison, administered
a month before, would have produced. They were of
longer standing than immediately antecedent to death. In the
duodenum and intestines the body had in colour and otherwise
the appearances characteristic of arsenical poisoning. Inflammation
and ulceration are the effect of inflammation; jaundice, I mean
the yellow tinge of the skin, is an occasional, but not a necessary
symptom of death by arsenic, but not a common one. Extreme
thirst is one of the symptoms, and shows itself very early. It is
not characteristic of British cholera in its earlier stages. The exact
time a dose of arsenic takes to exhibit its symptoms is from a half
to one hour&mdash;that is the average time. Longer periods have been
known but are very unusual. They depend more on the mode in
which the poison is given, and the state of the stomach, than on
the quantity administered. If a person had been the subject of
repeated doses, the irritability of the stomach would make it more
likely to operate quickly. I have read of cases of murder where
large quantities of arsenic have been found in the stomach. I can
refer to cases in which details were not given, but the quantity was
said to be large.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness was mainly directed
to his assertion that the yellowness of the skin seen in jaundice,
and, as he added, of the conjunctiva of the eye also, was
a known symptom in arsenical poison, but he admitted that
the statement in Dr. Taylor’s book was his only authority:
he only “knew it to be a secondary symptom from arsenical
poisoning in his routine.” He admitted also that the ulcers
on the duodenum might arise from some enteric fever, and
that any cause of inflammation might produce them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>On <i>re-examination by the Lord Advocate</i>, he repeated that
from his reading and study he knew jaundice to be an occasional
symptom of arsenical poisoning. To a question
whether “in a person during life who immediately after
taking food had been seized with severe pain and intense
thirst, he should think, because he had a yellow colour, that
might not be the effect of arsenical poisoning?” he replied
“that might or might not be,” and “that the appearance of
jaundice would not sway him materially one way or the
other.” This witness, though he had made many <i>post-mortem</i>
examinations, had only once before done so in a case
of arsenical poisoning. With this witness the medical evidence
for the prosecution was closed.</p>

<p>It will be convenient, as in Palmer’s case, to give in this
place the evidence of the medical witnesses, called, at a subsequent
period, for the defence.</p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>Two physicians were called for the prisoner, with the
object of proving (1), that arsenic could be used without
danger as a cosmetic; (2), that the symptoms in L’Angelier’s
last illness were consistent with the suggestion that he died
of some form of cholera.</p>

<p><i>Dr. James A. Lawrie</i>, a physician of Glasgow, many years
in practice, who was first called, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He had taken a quarter or half-an-ounce of arsenic, bought at
<i>Currie’s</i>, and washed his hands freely with it, and on the previous
Saturday had tried the same experiment with a half-an-ounce
on his face, but washed his face afterwards with cold water. The
effect was the same as using a ball of soap with sand&mdash;it softened
the skin. He filled the basin with the usual quantity of water,
and mixed the arsenic with it. It was a practice he should have
no fear of repeating, and would not hesitate in using, if he had a
case that required it, such as vermin on the skin. In consequence
of the insolubility of arsenic, he did not think that increasing the
quantity of arsenic would make any difference in the effect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On the second point this witness said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I treated one case of poisoning by arsenic. Some years ago
during the prevalence of cholera, I was asked to see a gentleman
about seven or eight in the evening, and the account was that he
had been ill since three or four in the morning. I found him
labouring under premonitory symptoms of cholera, and I prescribed
for him. I returned about ten, and found the symptoms very
much aggravated, and the vomiting and purging still continued.
His voice was not affected, and the vomiting was not the same as
in cholera. It was a reddish yellowish matter, and I requested it
to be set aside. I thought it was not a case of cholera, and asked
him what he had taken. He said only his ordinary food, wine,
&amp;c., but nothing else. The symptoms went on still further, and
I called a consultation of other medical men. He still said he had
taken nothing. I was satisfied from the aggravation of the symptoms
that something else was the matter, and at last he died about
three in the morning. I next day learnt that he had purchased
half-an-ounce of arsenic the day of his death. I had the vomit
and contents of stomach analysed, and discovered arsenic in great
quantities. Extreme thirst, as far as I know, is an early symptom
in poisoning by arsenic&mdash;but not equally so in cholera, it belongs
to a later stage in cholera.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Douglas Maclagan</i>, of Edinburgh, who had had some
experience in arsenical poisonings, and devoted much of his
time to chemistry, had the same opinion as Dr. Lawrie of
the innocuousness of arsenic as a cosmetic (mainly from its
insolubility).</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Unless there was some ulceration or abrasion of the skin, or it
was kept long in contact with it. In warm water it would dissolve
to a greater extent than in cold&mdash;in which some such proportion
as only one 400th part would dissolve, and if you required to
dissolve any great quantity it must, according to Dr. Taylor, be
boiled violently for half-an-hour, and then it retains about 1-40th
of its weight after the water cools.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Will the presence of organic matter in a fluid interfere
with its solvent power upon arsenic?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“As a rule, it generally will. There does not appear
to be any difference between tea, coffee, or water when poured upon
arsenic. They dissolve but a very small quantity, I do not know
how you can determine whether cocoa or chocolate is a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
solvent or not. You cannot filter them so as to determine the
quantity. There is a great deal of organic matter in the ordinary
chocolate or cocoa, it ought to be entirely organic matter, except
so far as it is water.” (The Witness then gave an account of a
case of a girl whom he attended, who took arsenic by accident,
mistaking it for an effervescing powder.) “We all know the ordinary
symptoms of arsenical poisoning. Most of them are very
similar to, almost identical with, the symptoms of cholera. In the
case of slight quantities of arsenic, it would appear that the
symptoms very closely resemble those of what are called bilious or
British cholera. In fatal cases they are more like malignant or
Asiatic cholera.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Can you diagnose a case of arsenical poisoning by
the symptoms?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I believe you may. In the first place the vomiting
would be bloody, from the violent irritation and the pouring out of
a bloody mucus into the stomach&mdash;after that has been emptied of
all its contents. I suppose there would be more affections of some
of the mucous membranes, an unaccountable occurrence of an extensive
inflammatory redness about the eyes, and the occurrence of
nervous symptoms, such, for instance, as paralysis of the limbs.
But these are not necessary symptoms. A person may be suffering
from the effects of arsenic without these being produced if the
quantity is small.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“You never saw jaundice as a symptom of arsenical
poisoning?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I am not entitled to speak on my own experience, as
I never saw it. There is a single line in Taylor’s book, which
says, that it has been observed, and which refers to the remarks of
Dr. Marshall on Turner’s case.” (Extract read.)</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Is that a description of jaundice?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It is a description of at least one symptom of jaundice,
yellowness of the skin; but it is rather strange that it does not
mention the most common of all signs of jaundice, yellowness of
the eyes. One looks to the eye first in a case of jaundice, because
you see it best there.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Do you think that a sensation of choking and a
feeling of irritation of the throat are symptoms of arsenical
poisoning?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Certainly.”</p>

<p><i>The Dean.</i>&mdash;“Would that occur in a case of British cholera?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I have seen persons who are affected with choleraic
symptoms complaining of being sore about the throat, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
generally the soreness arising from what they first vomit, and
after that it is the muscular soreness.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by the Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“What is it that causes
the yellow outline of the eyes and skin?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“The absorption of the choleraic matter into the
blood.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“I presume there is nothing in a case of
arsenical poisoning that produces that?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“It is certainly very remarkable that we have so many
cases of arsenical poisoning where the jaundice shows itself: we
have eruption of those same parts of the duodenum according with
arsenical poisoning. I am not so certain that jaundice is a symptom
of arsenical poisoning.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“But if you saw the appearance of the
eye was much darker than usual, would that lead you to think
there might be jaundice?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Oh, certainly.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“I knew a case of apparent jaundice
arising from a cake of yellow soap.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Suppose you were told that in a case the
body after death had a yellow appearance, and it was found to be
the effect of arsenical poisoning, would you not be surprised at
that?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No, not at the yellowish aspect of the skin, but I
would not expect that there would be marked jaundice.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“And if you found any symptom of that
kind, where repeated doses of poison had been taken during the
period from the time when the patient took ill, what would you
say?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“If such a case did occur, I should say that there
would be some connection between the cause of death and the
occurrence of the jaundice.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“In regard to the vomiting, is there not a
great difference in different kinds of arsenical poisoning?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Generally the vomiting is severe.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“You state that the presence of organic matter
detracts from the power of holding arsenic in solution: would you
say the same as to holding it in suspension?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Certainly not.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Is great thirst a symptom of arsenic?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Generally it is, and generally an early and persistent
symptom.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Is it so in cholera?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I should say that I have seen thirst very early in
cholera. I think it is usually so. I do not know any injurious
effect that would result if the face were washed with water containing
arsenic, if you kept your mouth and eyes shut, but I do
not recommend it.”</p>

<p><i>To the Dean.</i>&mdash;“I cannot say how much arsenic would be held
in suspension by an ordinary cupful of chocolate and cocoa. It
must depend upon the kind of chocolate. Cocoa in this country
is generally thin, but chocolate in France is generally as thick as
porridge. It is not so in this country.”</p></div>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ADMINISTRATION
OF POISON.</p>

<p>On the <i>first</i> charge, that of administering poison on the
19th or 20th of February, it was urged on the jury that there
was no reliable evidence that the lovers had met on either of
these days, that Madeline Smith had at that time poison in her
possession, or that the illness which L’Angelier was supposed
to have had at that time showed arsenical symptoms. On
the 17th of February L’Angelier told Miss Perry, the confidante
of their loves, that he expected to meet Madeline on
the 19th, and, from some other circumstances&mdash;what they
were is not stated&mdash;when on the 2nd of March he told her
how ill he had been, falling on the floor of his room, she said
that “she knew that he referred to the 19th of February.”
Mrs. Jenkins, however, could not fix the date of this attack:
it might have been eight or ten days before the second illness
(February 23), and, like his illness in January, she believed
it to be due to bile, the symptoms being something the same
as her own but more violent, on both occasions accompanied
by a good deal of purging and vomiting. From Dr. Thomson’s
evidence, however, it appears that his first illness in
that year, which Dr. Thomson places on the 3rd of February,
was due to a cold, with cough and boils, for which he prescribed.
The only attempt that Miss Smith made to purchase
poison before that date was that of sending the page
boy to Dr. Yeaman’s to buy some prussic acid, which the
doctor refused to sell to her. The Lord Advocate admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
that he could not prove that she had arsenic in her possession
before that illness. “It would not do,” said the Lord Justice
Clerk in his charge, “to infer, from her having arsenic
afterwards, that she had it also on the first occasion.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>On the second charge, that of administering poison on the
22nd or 23rd of February, the following evidence was offered.
On the 21st of February Miss Smith openly purchased an
ounce and a half of arsenic of the chemist Murdoch, ostensibly
for the purpose&mdash;a false one, as the evidence proved&mdash;of
killing rats at her father’s country house. It was mixed
with soot, of which she some days afterwards spoke to the
chemist, saying she thought arsenic was white. If, therefore,
the lovers met on the 22nd, or 23rd, she had poison in
her possession. Whether L’Angelier went out on the night
of the 22nd, his landlady could not say:<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> she did not hear
him come in, but, when she went into his room early the
next morning, she found him suffering from his second attack
of illness for which Dr. Thomson attended him, and from
which he recovered in about eight days. That the symptoms
were those of arsenical poisoning was hardly to be doubted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and though Dr. Thomson at the time attributed them to
billious derangement, he said, that, “had he known that
L’Angelier had taken an irritant poison, those were the symptoms
he should expect to follow.” The evidence that the
lovers had met on the night of the 22nd, or morning of the
23rd, rested on a letter, which not only did not bear any date
or day of the week, but the post-mark on which was so
obliterated that the post-office official could not fix any date,
though he thought he could see the “M” of March on the
stamp, which counsel on both sides agreed in considering an
error. In that letter Miss Smith wrote: “I am so sorry to
hear you are ill. I hope to God you will soon be better&mdash;&mdash; you
did look bad on Sunday night and Monday morning. I
think you got sick with walking home so late, and the long
want of food; so, next time we meet, I shall make you eat a
loaf of bread before you go.” This letter the Lord Advocate
assumed to be written on Wednesday, the 25th of February,
and to refer to the meeting on the night of the 22nd and
morning of the 23rd. To Miss Perry, on the 9th of March,
L’Angelier spoke of having had a cup of coffee and chocolate
from Miss Smith, which Miss Perry understood to refer to
two occasions, and added, “I can’t think why I was so unwell
after getting that coffee and chocolate from her.” “It ought
not to be forgotten,” said the Lord Justice Clerk, “that the
contents of the stomach on these two illnesses had not been
examined, and therefore it was merely an inference that they
were caused by arsenic&mdash;an inference drawn from the fact
that on the 22nd of March he died from that poison.” With
reference to the purchase of arsenic, the learned Judge
added: “He attached little importance to the statements of
the druggists as to what was said by the prisoner about rats;
without stating some such objects she would not have got it
at all; and it was not to be supposed, if she had wanted it as
a cosmetic, that she would tell the druggist. Did she see
the deceased on the Sunday night, before the arsenic was
administered? Mrs. Jenkins did not see him go out of the
house that night, and he asked the jury to consider whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
there was, on the whole, apart from the correspondence, evidence
that they had met together that night? If there was
no proof that the administration took place on the 22nd of
February, then there was great force in the observation that
the foundation of the case for the prosecution had been
shaken.”</p>

<p>On the third charge&mdash;that of poisoning on the 22nd or
23rd of March, the following facts were proved. On his
return to work, after his second illness, L’Angelier was so
altered in health, his complexion wan, with a dark, hectic
spot on each cheek, that leave of absence was given to him,
for the first time since he had been in this employ. Miss
Smith had advised him to take rest and change, and
L’Angelier had apparently told her that he should go to the
Bridge of Allan. On the third of March, however, Miss
Smith writes that her family are going to the same place, and
the next day suggests that he should go to the South of
England. On the 5th of March he writes her a painfully
earnest letter on the reports about her intended marriage
with Mr. Minnoch, concluding: “Mind, I insist on having
an explicit answer to the question you evaded in my last.”
Next day the prisoner purchases another sixpenny-worth of
arsenic, not again of Murdoch, but of Currie, and this time
the excuse is that the house in Blythswood Square is so
overrun with rats, that it is to be shut up and the servants
sent away till the vermin is eradicated. This again was pure
invention on her part. The family went to the Bridge of
Allan, whence on Tuesday, the 10th of March, the prisoner
wrote to L’Angelier that they would be home again in
Glasgow on the next Monday or Tuesday, when she would
write to arrange an interview, adding, “I long to see you, to
kiss and embrace you, my only sweet love.” Before this the
Minnoch marriage had been arranged, and the day talked
about, if not definitively fixed. Again on the 13th she wrote
him: “I think we shall be home on Tuesday, so I shall let
you know, my own beloved sweet pet, when we shall have a
dear, sweet interview; when I may be pressed to your heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and kissed by you, my own sweet love. A fond, tender embrace;
a kiss, sweet love! I hope you will enjoy your visit here.” It
had been previously arranged between them that L’Angelier
should not come to the Bridge of Allan until her family had left.</p>

<p>During this visit of the Smiths to the Bridge of Allan,
L’Angelier was taking his leave of absence. On the 6th of
March he left for Edinburgh, and returned to Glasgow on the
17th, and, finding no letter for him, stayed at home all the
next day waiting for it. On the 19th he left for the Bridge
of Allan, where he was to stay for a week, his friend Thuau
undertaking to forward his letters. On the 19th, after he
had left, a letter came, and Thuau forwarded it that night,
and it reached Stirling at nine the next morning. That
letter was not to be found. In his tourist’s bag, however,
the envelope of it was discovered, and, from a letter which he
wrote to Miss Perry on the 20th, in which he said, “I should
have come to see some one last night, but the letter was too
late,” it may be fairly assumed that it contained the wished
for appointment for the Thursday night. On the 18th the
prisoner bought her third packet of arsenic at Currie’s.
Several dead rats, she said, had been found, and it was
feared some large ones still remained. This time she had a
female companion with her, and, as she had to Murdoch
expressed her surprise at the arsenic she had previously purchased
not being white, she again used the same expression at
Currie’s. This arsenic was coloured with indigo. On the
21st the last of the long series of letters reached L’Angelier’s
lodgings, and was forwarded at once by Thuau. “Why, my
beloved, did you not come to me?” she wrote. “Oh, my
beloved, are you ill? Come to me. Sweet one, I waited
and waited for you, but you came not. I shall wait again
to-morrow night&mdash;same hour and arrangement.” That letter,
which was found in his pocket, was received by him after
nine on Sunday morning. He left the Bridge of Allan shortly
after evening service began, and was at his lodgings by eight
o’clock that evening. To accomplish this L’Angelier had
walked to Stirling, taken the train from there to Coatbridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
where a Mr. Ross found him, and, after some refreshment at
the station, walked with him to Glasgow, apparently quite
well, and walking briskly.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> When he arrived at his lodgings
he appeared greatly improved in health since he left on the
previous Thursday, was in high spirits, and said that the
letter had brought him back. He left his lodgings about
nine o’clock, is seen soon after sauntering in the direction of
Blythswood Square, but not near the Smiths’ house, as it
was the hour there for family prayers. To wile away the
time he calls on a Mr. M’Alister, who is not at home, and
from that time till he came back to his lodgings, after midnight,
all trace of him is lost. At two o’clock the next
morning the door-bell rang violently; his landlady went
down, and found L’Angelier at the door, standing with his
arms across his stomach. He was suffering from his fatal
illness, already too bad to be able to use his pass key. How
that attack progressed, and what its symptoms were, and
what was the result of the <i>post-mortem</i> and analytical examinations,
has already been reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here,” said the learned Judge, “the proof stops. And,
supposing you are quite satisfied that the letter brought him to
Glasgow,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> are you in a condition to say, with satisfaction to your
own consciences, that, as an inevitable and just result of that, you
can find it proved that they met that night?<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> That is the point
in the case. That you may have the strongest moral suspicion
that they met&mdash;that you may believe that he was able, after all
their clandestine correspondence, to obtain the means of an interview,
especially as she complained of his not coming on the
Thursday, said she would wait again to-morrow night, same hour
and place, and talked of wishing to clasp him to her bosom&mdash;that
you may suppose it likely that, although he failed to keep his
appointment on Saturday, she would be waiting on Sunday, which
was by no means an uncommon evening for their appointment&mdash;<i>all
that may be very true, and probably you will think so; but remember
you are trying this case upon evidence that must be satisfactory, complete,
and distinct.</i></p>

<p>“A jury may safely infer certain facts from the correspondence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
They may even safely infer that meetings took place, when they find
these meetings either mutually appointed or arranged for by the
parties. But it is for you to say here whether it has been proved that
L’Angelier was in the house that night. If you can hold that that
link in the chain is supplied by just and satisfactory inference&mdash;remember,
I say just and satisfactory&mdash;and it is for you to say
whether the inference is just and satisfactory in order to complete
the proof. If you really feel that in your own minds, you may
have the strongest suspicion that he saw her; for really no one
need hesitate to say that, as a matter of moral opinion, the whole
probabilities of the case are in favour of it. But if that is all the
amount that you can derive from it, the link still remains awanting&mdash;the
catastrophe and the alleged cause of it are not found
together. And therefore you must be satisfied that you can here
stand and rely upon the firm foundation, I say, of a just and sound,
and perhaps I may add, inevitable inference. That a jury is
entitled often to draw such an inference there is no doubt; and it
is just because you belong to that class of men to whom the Lord
Advocate referred, namely, men of common sense, capable of
exercising your judgment upon a matter which is laid before you to
consider, it is on that very account that you are to put to yourselves
the question, ‘Is this a satisfactory and a just inference?’ If you
find it so, I cannot tell you that you are not at liberty to act upon
it, because most of those matters occurring in life must depend
upon circumstantial evidence, and upon the inference a jury may
feel bound to draw. But it is an inference of a very serious
character&mdash;it is an inference upon which the death of this party by
the hand of the prisoner must depend.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p class="psh">CONDUCT AND STATEMENTS OF THE PRISONER AFTER
L’ANGELIER’S DEATH.</p>

<p>In her declaration Miss Smith stated that she heard of
L’Angelier’s death on the afternoon of Monday, the 23rd.
On the Wednesday evening she was out at a party, and at
eight o’clock the next morning she had left the house. In
consequence Mr. Minnoch, and a brother of the prisoner,
thinking apparently that she had gone to her father’s country
house, took the rail to Greenock, and the steamer thence to
Row, on board which they found her a little after two in the
afternoon. She said she was going to Rowaleyn, and they went
on with her, and from thence brought her to Glasgow in a
carriage. “When we met her on the steamboat,” said
Mr. Minnoch, “I asked her why she had left her house and
her friends in such distress at her absence. She made no
reply. I requested her not to do so among so many people.
I renewed my inquiry afterwards at Rowaleyn. She said she
felt distressed that her parents should be so much annoyed
at what she had done.” The suggestion on the part of the
prosecution was, that from conscious guilt she was fleeing
from justice&mdash;on the part of the prisoner, that she was
fleeing from the shame of an exposure of her love passages
with L’Angelier. “But,” said the learned judge, “my
opinion is, that having made a statement already about
getting arsenic for the gardener to kill rats, and knowing
that if it had been discovered that he got no arsenic for such
a purpose, unpleasant consequences might follow, she wished
to see him, in order to make an arrangement by which that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
statement might be borne out. The steamer in which she
went only sailed from Helensburgh to Gairloch and back,
and therefore escape by it was nearly impossible; and, in
point of fact, he did not believe she had any intention of
attempting it.”</p>

<p>Previously, however, to this unexplained flight from home,
she had been visited by the French consul, a mutual friend
of the lovers, to whose searching questions in the presence
of her mother she gave most decided answers. As this
witness’s evidence was greatly relied on by counsel for the
prisoner, it is reported in full.</p>

<p><i>M. Auguste Vauvert de Meau</i>, the French Consul at
Glasgow, who had known L’Angelier for three years, was acquainted
with the prisoner’s family, and aware from L’Angelier’s
own statements of the correspondence between the
lovers, gave the following evidence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I remember L’Angelier coming to my office a few weeks before
his death and speaking about Miss Smith. I said she was to be
married to some gentleman, and when I mentioned the public
rumour, he said it was not true, but, if it was, he had documents
in his possession that would be sufficient to forbid the banns. I
did not see her after that time. I thought that, having been
received by Mr. Smith in his house, I was not at liberty to speak
to him; but after L’Angelier’s death I thought it was my duty to
mention the fact of the correspondence having been carried on
between them, in order that he might take steps to exonerate
his daughter in case of anything coming out. In the evening of
the death of L’Angelier, I called on Mr. Smith and told him that
L’Angelier had in his possession a great number of letters from his
daughter, and that it was high time to let him know this, that
they might not fall into the hands of strangers, numbers of people
might go to his lodgings and read them. I went to Mr. Huggins’s
office (L’Angelier’s employer). He was not in, but I saw two
gentlemen, and told them what I had been told to ask (to get back
the letters); but they said that they could not give them up
without Mr. Huggins’s consent, and I then asked them to keep
the letters sealed up till they were disposed of. I think this was
on the Tuesday after L’Angelier’s death. Shortly after I saw
Mr. Smith. In consequence of rumours I went to his house and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Miss Smith in the presence of her mother. I apprised her of
the death of L’Angelier. She asked me if it was of my own will
that I came to tell her; I told her it was not so, but at the
special request of her father. <i>I asked her if she had seen L’Angelier
on the Sunday night; she told me that she did not see him.</i> I asked her
to put me in a position to contradict the statements which were
being made as to her relation with L’Angelier, and asked her again
if she did not see him on Sunday evening or Sunday night, and
she told me she did not. I observed to her that L’Angelier
had come from the Bridge of Allan to Glasgow on a special
appointment with her, by a letter written to him. <i>She told me she
was not aware that he was at the Bridge of Allan before he came to
Glasgow, and that she did not give him an appointment for Sunday
evening, as she wrote him on Friday evening giving him an appointment
for Saturday: she had expected him on the Saturday, but he did not
come, and she had not seen him on Sunday.</i> I put the question to her
five or six times in different ways. I told her that my conviction
was that she must have seen him on Sunday, that he had come on
purpose to Glasgow on a special invitation by her to see her; and
I did not think it likely, admitting that he had committed suicide,
that he had done so without knowing why she had asked him to
come to Glasgow.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“Did you know of this letter yourself?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I heard there was such a letter. I said to her that
the best advice that a friend could give to her under the circumstances
was to tell the truth about it, because the case was a very
grave one, and would lead to an inquiry on the part of the authorities,
and that if she did not say the truth in these circumstances,
perhaps it would be ascertained by a servant, or a policeman, or
somebody passing the house who had seen L’Angelier, that he had
been in the house, and this would cause a strong suspicion as to
the motive that had led her to conceal the truth. <i>Miss Smith
then got up from her chair and said, ‘I swear to you, Mr. Meau,
that I have not seen L’Angelier not on that Sunday only, but not for
three weeks or six weeks,’ I am not sure which.</i>”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“And the mother was present?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes. I repeated this question five or six times, but
her answer was always the same. I asked her with regard to the
letter inviting L’Angelier to come and see her, how it was that,
being engaged to another gentleman, she could have carried on a
clandestine correspondence with a former sweetheart? she said it
was to get back her letters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Did you ask her whether she was in the
habit of meeting L’Angelier?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes. I asked her if it was true that L’Angelier was
in the habit of having appointments with her in her house; and
<i>she told me that he had never entered that house, meaning the Blythswood
Square house, as I understood</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> I asked her how, then, she
had her appointments to meet him? She told me that he used to
come to a street at the corner of the house (main street), that he
had a signal by knocking with his stick, and that she used to talk
to him.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“Did she speak about her former correspondence
with him at all?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I asked her if it was true she had signed letters in
his name, and she said she had done so.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean that she added his
name to hers?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I meant whether she signed her letters with
L’Angelier’s name, and she said ‘Yes.’ I did not ask her why.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Young.</i>&mdash;“I went to live at Helensburgh
in 1845. M. L’Angelier visited me, and once he came on a
Saturday to my lodgings there, and on Sunday we went on the
Luss Road. I went up to my room, and L’Angelier not coming in
for his dinner, I called for him out of temper. I then found that
he was ill, and was vomiting down the staircase. He once complained
to me of being bilious. This was a year ago. He complained
of once having the cholera. Last year he came to my
office and told me he had had a violent attack of cholera, but I
don’t know whether that was a year or two years ago. I think it
was a journey he was to have made that led him to speak of having
had the cholera. I don’t recollect whether he was unwell at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
time. I know that when he came to my house he always had a
bottle of laudanum in his bag, but I don’t know if he used it. I
once heard him speak of arsenic; it must have been in the winter
of 1854. It was on a Sunday. I don’t recollect how the conversation
arose, but it lasted half an hour. Its purport was how
much arsenic a person could take without its injuring him. He
maintained that it was possible to do it, by taking small quantities.
I don’t know what led to the conversation, and should be afraid to
make any statement as to the purpose for which it was to be taken.
L’Angelier stated to me he had once been jilted by an English lady,
a rich person, and that on account of the deception he was almost
mad for a fortnight, and ran about, getting food from a farmer in
the country. He was easily excited: when he had any cause of
grief he was affected very much.”</p>

<p><i>By the Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“After my marriage I had little
intercourse with L’Angelier. I thought that he might be led to
take some harsh steps with Miss Smith, and as I had some young
ladies in my house, I did not think it was proper to have the same
intercourse with him as when I was a bachelor.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“What do you mean by ‘harsh steps?’”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I was afraid of an elopement. By ‘harsh’ I mean
‘rash.’ This was after L’Angelier had given me his full confidence
as to what he would do if her father did not consent to the
marriage.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“ Did you understand that Miss Smith
had engaged herself to him?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I understood so from what he said.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“When you used the expression ‘you
thought it right to go to Mr. Smith about the letters, in order that
he might take steps to vindicate his daughter’s honour, or prevent
it from being disparaged,’ did you relate to him her engagement
and apparent breach of it? Had you in view that the letters
might contain an engagement which she was breaking, or that she
had made a clandestine engagement?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I thought that these letters were love letters, and
that it would be much better that they should be in Mr. Smith’s
hands than in those of strangers.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Advocate.</i>&mdash;“ What were L’Angelier’s usual character
and habits?”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“Was he a steady fellow?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“My opinion of L’Angelier’s character at the moment
of his death was, that he was a most regular young man in his conduct,
religious, and in fact most exemplary in all his conduct. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
only objection which I heard made to him was that he was vain and
a boaster&mdash;boasting of grand persons that he knew. For example,
when he spoke of Miss Smith, he would say, I shall forbid Madeline
to do such a thing, or such another thing&mdash;to dance with
such a one or such another.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Cleric.</i>&mdash;“Did he boast of any success with
females?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Never.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“Did he seem jealous of Miss Smith
paying attention to others?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No; of others paying attention to her.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“It was not on account of any levity in
his character that you discouraged him visiting you after your
marriage?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No. I thought his society might be fit for a
bachelor, but not for a married man.”</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“Do you understand the word
‘levity’?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes; lightness, irregularity. There had been a long
cessation of intercourse between us before his death. The photograph
(<i>shown him</i>) is a good likeness; he was between 28 and 30
years of age. I think I got accidentally acquainted with him in a
house in Glasgow.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">At the close of the case for the prosecution the Lord Advocate
proposed to put in certain entries in a pocket book of
L’Angelier’s to support the first and second counts of the indictment,
which, after argument, was refused by the Court.
(See <a name="see_c" id="see_c">Appendix C.</a>, p. <a href="#app_c">359</a>.)</p>

<p class="psh">THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>In accordance with practice of the Scotch Courts the
counsel for the prisoner had the last word; and good use
did the Dean of Faculty make of his privilege. The Lord
Advocate’s policy had been to depict the character of the
prisoner in the vilest colours&mdash;as the seducer, rather than
the seduced, or, at any rate, for a long period the willing
accomplice in all his acts. The Dean dealt not less hardly
with the character of L’Angelier.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We find him,” he said, “according to the confession of all those
who observed him narrowly, vain, conceited, pretentious, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
great opinion of his own personal attractions, and a very silly expectation
of admiration from the other sex. That he was successful
to a certain extent in conciliating such admiration may be the
fact; but, at all events, his own prevailing ideas seem to have been
that he was calculated to be very successful in paying attention to
ladies, and that he was likely to push his fortune by such means.
Accordingly, once and again we find him engaged in attempts to get
married to women of some station at least in society. We heard of
one disappointment which he met with in England, and another we
heard a great deal of connected with a lady in Fife; and the
manner in which he bore his disappointments on those two occasions
is perhaps the best indication and light we have to the true
character of the man. He was not a person of strong health, and
it is extremely probable that this, among other things, had a
depressing effect on his spirits, rendering him changeable and
uncertain&mdash;now uplifted, as one of the witnesses said, and now
most deeply depressed&mdash;of a mercurial temperament, as another
described it, very variable and never to be depended upon. Such
was the individual with whom the prisoner unfortunately became
acquainted. The progress of their acquaintance is soon told. My
learned friend the Lord Advocate said the correspondence must
have been improper, because it was clandestine: yet the letters of
the young lady at that first period breathe nothing but gentleness
and propriety. The correspondence in the commencement shows
that if L’Angelier had in his mind originally to corrupt and
seduce the prisoner, he entered upon the attempt with considerable
ingenuity and skill; for the very first letter of the series which we
have contains a passage in which she says, ‘I am trying to break
myself of all my bad habits: it is you I have to thank for this,
which I do sincerely from my heart.’ He had been suggesting to
her improvement in conduct or something else. He had thus been
insinuating himself into her company. She had yielded, no doubt,
too easily to the pleasures of this new acquaintance, but pleasures
apparently of a most innocent kind at this period. Yet it seems
to have occurred to her mind at a very early period that it was
impossible to maintain this correspondence with propriety or her
own welfare; for so early as April 1855 she wrote him&mdash;‘I think
you will agree with me in what I intend proposing, that for the
present this correspondence had better stop. I know your good
feeling will not take this wrong. It was meant quite the reverse.
By continuing it, harm may arise, by discontinuing, nothing can
be said.’ And from then to September it did cease.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Unfortunately the correspondence was renewed, discovered,
and stopped by her father until April, 1856, when it is
re-opened by a letter, of the 30th of that month, from Helensburgh,
in which she writes:&mdash;“P(papa) has not been in
town a night for some time; but the first night he is off I
shall see you. We shall spend an hour of bliss. There
shall be no risk: only C. H. (Haggart) shall know.” This
letter was followed by that of the 3rd of May, inviting him
on Tuesday, the 6th, to come to the garden gate, and adding,
“Beloved of my soul, a fond embrace, a dear kiss till we meet!
We shall have more than one, love, dearest.” Signed, “From
thy ever devoted and loving wife, thine for ever, <span class="smcap">Mini</span>.”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Alas,” said the Dean, “the next scene is the most painful of
all. In the spring of 1856, the corrupting influence of the seducer
was successful, and the prisoner fell. This is recorded in a letter
bearing the post-mark of the 7th of May, which you have heard
read. And how corrupting that influence must have been, how
vile the acts that he resorted to for accomplishing his nefarious
purpose, can never be proved so well as by looking at the altered
tone and language of the unhappy prisoner’s letters. She had lost
not her virtue merely, but, as the Lord Advocate said, her sense
of decency. Think you that without temptation, without evil
teachings, a poor girl falls into such depths of degradation? No.
Influence from without&mdash;most corrupting influence&mdash;can alone
account for such a fact. And yet through the midst of this frightful
correspondence, there breathes a spirit of devoted affection towards
the man that had destroyed her&mdash;that strikes me as most
remarkable.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then, after alluding to the precautions with which she
sought to surround her interviews with L’Angelier at the
Blythswood Square house; to the evident proofs that an
elopement was projected, and to the strong probability that
no interview took place without Haggart’s connivance, and
that, therefore, the interviews at this time must be limited
to the two spoken of by that witness, he urged that up to
the month of February, 1857, he was entitled to say, “without
a shadow of evidence to the contrary, that they were not
in the habit of coming into personal contact.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We now,” continued the Dean, “come to a very important
stage of the case. On the 28th of February Mr. Minnoch proposes,
and if I understand the theory of my learned friend’s
case aright, from that day the whole character of the girl’s mind
and her feelings changed, and she set herself to prepare for the
perpetration of what he has called one of the most foul, cool, deliberate
murders that ever was committed. I will not say that
such a thing is impossible, but I will venture to say it is very highly
improbable. He will be a bold man to fathom the depths of human
depravity, but this at least experience teaches us, that perfection
even in depravity, is not rapidly attained, and it is not by such
short and easy stages as the prosecutor has been able to trace in
the career of Madeline Smith, that a gentle loving girl passes all
at once into the savage grandeur of a Medea, or the appalling
wickedness of a Borgia. Such a thing is not possible. There is a
certain progress in guilt, and it is quite out of all human experience
that, from the tone of the letters, there should be a sudden
transition&mdash;I will not say from affection for a particular object&mdash;but
to the strange desire for removing, by any means, the obstruction
to her wishes and purposes that the prosecutor imputes to the
prisoner. Think, in your own minds, how foul and unnatural a
murder it is&mdash;the murder of one who, within a very short space,
was the object of her love&mdash;an unworthy object&mdash;an unholy object;
but yet while it lasted&mdash;and its endurance was not very brief&mdash;it
was a deep, unselfish, absorbing, devoted passion. And the object
of that passion she now conceived the purpose of murdering. Such
is the theory that you are desired to believe. Now before you
will believe it, will you not ask for demonstration? Will you be
content with conjecture? Will you be content with suspicion,
however pregnant, or will you be so unreasonable as to put it to
me in this form, that the man having died of poison, the theory of
the prosecution is the most probable? Oh, gentlemen, is that
the manner in which a jury should treat such a case? Is that
the kind of proof on which they should convict on a capital
offence?”</p>

<p class="p1">The Dean, then, took up <i>seriatim</i> the three charges,
examining the evidence on each in detail, making on each
the criticisms, already reported in the previous summary of
the evidence, showing how the first charge had failed even in
the opinion of the prosecutor: how doubtful, to say the least,
it was that the interview on which the second charge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
based had taken place, and the weakness of many of the proofs
on which the charge of murder was rested. Passing, then,
to the suggestion of suicide, he continued&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I might stop here, for nothing could be more fallacious than
the suggestion of the Lord Advocate, that it was necessary to explain
how this man came by his death. His lordship will tell you
that a defendant has no further duty than to repel the charge and
stand on the defensive, and maintain that the case for the prosecution
is not proved. No man probably can tell at the present
moment&mdash;I believe no man on earth can tell&mdash;how L’Angelier met
his death. Nor am I under the slightest obligation even to suggest
to you a possible manner in which that death may have been compassed
without the intervention of the prisoner. Yet it is but fair,
when we are dealing with so many matters of conjecture and suspicion,
that we should, for a moment, consider whether that supposition
on which the charge is founded is preferable in itself, in
respect to its higher probabilities, to other suppositions which may
be fairly made. The character of this man, his origin, his early
history, the nature of his conversation, the numerous occasions on
which he spoke of suicide, naturally suggest that as one mode by
which he may have departed this life. Understand me, I am not
undertaking to prove that he died by his own hand&mdash;but I think
there is more to be said for suicide than for the prisoner’s guilt.
But I entreat you to remember that that is no necessary part of
my defence. But of course I should be using you very ill&mdash;should
be doing less than my duty to the prisoner&mdash;if I had not brought
before you the whole of that evidence which suggests the extreme
probability of that man dying by his own hand at one time or
other. From the very first time at which we see him, even as a
lad, in the year 1843, he talks in a manner to impress people with
the notion that he had no moral principle to guide him. He speaks
over and over again of suicide at Edinburgh, Dundee, and elsewhere&mdash;ay,
the prisoners letters shew that he had made the same
threat to her<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>&mdash;that he would put himself out of existence. And
is it half as violent a supposition as the supposition of this foul
murder, that upon this evening&mdash;the 22nd of March&mdash;a fit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
that kind of madness which he himself described, came over him,
when he met with disappointment&mdash;finding, it may be, that he
could not procure access to an interview which he desired&mdash;assuming
that he came to Glasgow for that purpose&mdash;assuming
even that he mistook the evening of the meeting, and
expected to see her on the Sunday&mdash;can anything be more probable
than that, in the excited state in which he then was, he should have
committed the rash act which put an end to his existence.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Again, in answer to the motive imputed by the prosecution;
re-reading the letter of the 10th of February, in which
on her bended knees Miss Smith besought him, “as he
hoped for mercy at the judgment, not to inform on her&mdash;not
to expose her;” asked him “to pardon her if he could;
to pray for her as the most wretched, guilty, miserable
creature on the earth;” told him “she could stand anything
but her father’s hot temper;” when she wrote, “Emile, you
will not cause my death. If he is to get your letters, I
cannot see him any more; and my poor mother, I will never
kiss her. It would be a shame to them all. Emile, will you
not spare me? Hate me, despise me, but do not expose me.”
The Dean said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Is that the language of deceit? Is that the mind of a murderess,
or can any one affect that frame of mind? Can you for one
moment listen to the suggestion that that letter covers a piece of
deceit? No, no. The finest actress could not have written that
to him, unless she had felt it; and is that the condition in which a
woman goes about to compass the death of him whom she has
loved? Is that the frame of mind?&mdash;shame for past sins, burning
shame, dread of exposure, grief at the injury she had done her
parents? Is that the frame of mind that would lead a woman&mdash;not
to advance another step on the road to destruction, but to
plunge at once into the depths of human wickedness? The thing
is preposterous, and yet it is because of her despair, as my learned
friend called it, exhibited in that and similar letters, that he says
she had a motive to destroy this man. What does that mean?
It may mean, in a certain improper sense of the term, that it
would have been of advantage to her that he should cease to
live. That is not a motive in any proper sense of the term. If
some advantage resulting from the death of another be a motive
to the commission of murder, a man’s eldest son must always
have a motive to murder him that he may succeed to his estate;
and I suppose the youngest officer in any regiment of Her Majesty’s
army has a motive to murder all the officers in his regiment&mdash;the
younger he is, and the further he has to ascend the
scale, the more murders he has a motive to commit. Away with
such nonsense! A motive to commit a crime must be something
a great deal more than the mere fact that the result of
that crime might be advantageous to the person committing it.
You must see the motive in action&mdash;you must see it influencing
the conduct&mdash;before you can deal with it as a motive; for this,
and this only, is it a motive in the proper sense of the term&mdash;that
is to say, it is moving to the perpetration of the deed. But let me
ask you what possible motive there could be, even in the most
improper and illegitimate sense of the term&mdash;I mean what possible
advantage could she expect from L’Angelier’s death so long as the
letters remained? Without the return of her letters she gained
nothing. Her object, her greatest desire, that for which she was
yearning with her whole soul, was to prevent the exposure of her
shame. But the death of L’Angelier, with those letters in his
possession, instead of insuring that object, would have been perfectly
certain to lead to the immediate exposure of everything that
passed between them. Shall I be told that she did not foresee
that? I think my learned friend had been giving the prisoner
credit for too much talent in the course of his observations on her
conduct. But I should conceive her to be infinitely stupid if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
could not foresee that the death of L’Angelier, with those documents
in his possession, was the true and best means of frustrating the
then great object of her life. Shall I be told that the motive
might be revenge? Listen to the letter, Tell me if it is possible
that in the same breast with these sentiments, there should link
one feeling of revenge! No; the condition of mind in which the
poor girl was throughout the months of February and March, is
entirely inconsistent with any of the hypotheses that have been
made on the other side&mdash;utterly incredible and wholly irreconcileable
with the perpetration of such a crime as is here laid to her
charge.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Passing on, then, to the incident of her sudden flight from
her home, when she heard of L’Angelier’s death, the Dean
repudiated the notion that she was absconding from justice.
She had left Glasgow early in the morning, and at half-past
three in the afternoon was found on board a steamer going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
from Greenock to Helensburgh. Any one going by rail could
easily have overtaken her.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“If her flight means anything,” he said, “it means flying from
what she could not bear&mdash;the wrath of her father, and the averted
countenance of her mother. But she came back again without
the slightest hesitation, and upon the Monday morning there occurred
a scene as remarkable in the history of criminal jurisprudence
as anything I ever heard of, by which that broken spirit was
altogether changed. The moment she was met by a charge of
being implicated in causing the death of L’Angelier, she at once
assumed the courage of a heroine. She was bowed down, and she
had fled, while the true charge of her unchastity and shame was
all that was brought against her; but she stood erect and proudly
conscious of her innocence when she was met with this astounding
charge of murder. You heard the account that M. de Meau gave
of that interview with her in her father’s house on the Monday.
That was a most striking statement, and given with a truthfulness
obviously that could not be surpassed. What was the import of
that conversation? He advised her, as a friend, if L’Angelier was
with her on that Sunday night, for God’s sake not to deny it.
And why? Because, he said, it is certain to be proved. A servant,
a policeman, a casual passenger, is certain to know the fact, and if
you falsely deny it, what a fact that will be against you. What
was the answer? In answer to five or six suggestions of M. de
Meau, she said at length that she would swear that she had not
seen him for three weeks. If she did not see him on the Sunday
that was true.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the purchases of arsenic, the Dean called the attention
of the jury to the improbability of her having purchased it
at the time when she was urging L’Angelier not to go to the
Bridge of Allan whilst she was there with her family, and to
her throwing it away on the 17th of March, and then buying
more on the 18th;&mdash;“throwing it away, it was said, when
just coming within reach of her victim, and then buying
more, with circumstances of openness and publicity inconsistent
with the hypothesis of any legitimate object? Why
expose herself to the necessity of a repeated purchase, when
she had got enough to poison twenty or a hundred men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“But,” continued the Dean, “the possession of this arsenic is
said to be unaccounted for, as far as the prisoner is concerned. It
might be so; it may be so; and yet that would not make out the
case for the prosecution. She says she used it as a cosmetic. This
might be startling at first sight to many of us here, but after the
evidence you have heard it will not amaze you. At school her
story, which has so far been borne out by evidence, shows that she
read of the Styrian peasants using it for strengthening their
wind, improving their complexions. No doubt they used it internally,
and not externally as she did, but in the imperfect state
of her knowledge that was a fact of no significance. L’Angelier,
too, was well aware of the same fact. He stated to more than one
witness&mdash;and if he stated falsely, it is only one of a multitude of
lies proved against him&mdash;that he used it himself. It is not surprising
if L’Angelier knew of this custom that he should have
communicated it to the prisoner, and that she should have used it
externally, for an internal use is apparently a greater danger,
which may have suggested to her to try it externally, and there is
no reason to suppose, that if used as she used it, it would produce
any injurious effects. No doubt we have medical men coming
here and shaking their heads and looking wise, and saying that
such a use of arsenic would be a dangerous procedure. That is not
the question. The question is whether the prisoner could use it
without injurious effects, and that she could do so is proved by the
experiments of Dr. Laurie and Dr. Maclagan. The publication in
<i>Chambers’s</i>, <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, and <i>Johnston’s</i> “<i>Chemistry of
Common Life</i>,” of information on the uses of arsenic, had reached
not the prisoner alone, but a multitude of other ladies, and had
incited them to the same kind of experiments. The two druggists&mdash;<i>Robertson</i>
and <i>Guthrie</i>&mdash;spoke to the fact of ladies having come
to their shops seeking arsenic for such purposes on the suggestion
of these publications. It cannot, therefore, be surprising to you
to learn that when the prisoner bought this arsenic, she intended
to use it, and did actually, afterwards, use it for this purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Then, citing the behaviour of Eliza Fenning, in the well-known
disputed, and even now disputed case, as a parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
instance of such behaviour as the prisoner showed when
taxed with the charge of murder:<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> repudiating the doctrine
that juries have nothing to do with the consequences of
their verdict, and that all questions of evidence must be
weighed in the same scale, whether the crime be capital, or
a mere case of pocket picking, and appealing to the jury not
to raise their rash and imprudent hands to tear away the
veil Providence has been pleased to place over this mystery,
the Dean closed his most effective speech.</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p>The most material comments of the Lord Justice Clerk
have been already so fully quoted as notes to the several
portions of the evidence, or to the points made by the counsel
for the defence, that it will now suffice to give his concluding
summary of the case.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The first charge is that she administered arsenic on the 19th or
20th of February. Probably you may come to the conclusion, on
the evidence of Miss Perry and others, that he did see her on that
occasion; but she was not proved to have had arsenic or any other
poison in her possession; and what I attach very great importance
to is, that there is no medical testimony, by analysis of the matter
vomited, that that illness did proceed from the administration of
arsenic. If the doctor had examined the vomit and proved that
there was arsenic there, I am afraid the case would have been very
strong against her as having given him coffee or something before
his illness on that occasion. But it is not proved that that illness
arose from the administration of poison. Arsenic she had not, and
there is no proof of her having possessed anything deleterious.
Therefore I have no hesitation in telling you that charge has
failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>“The second charge stands in a somewhat different position in
regard to the evidence, although in one respect it is similar to the
first, for it is not proved that the illness arose from the administration
of arsenic or any other poisonous substance. But then the
way in which you can connect the prisoner with a meeting on that
occasion is much stronger. Still if you should think you can
acquit her of the first charge, and that there is too much doubt to
prove the second proven, then you will observe how much this
weakens the case that has been raised by the prosecution on the
motives for revenge, on the change in the tone of the letters, and
the desire to allure him again to her embraces and fascinations,
which could not be accounted for except on the supposition of
some such murderous design. In that view undoubtedly the
foundation of the case is very much shaken, and will not lead you
to suppose that the purpose of murder was cherished on the
22nd.</p>

<p>“Then as to the charge for murder, the question for you to consider
is a simple one. No matter how the prisoner is surrounded
with grave suspicions, and with many circumstances that seem to
militate against the notion of innocence upon any theory that has
been propounded, still are you prepared to say that the interview
of the 22nd March has been proved against her? She had arsenic
before the illness of 22nd February, and I think you will consider
the excuse of using arsenic as a cosmetic of the same stamp as those
which she stated to the druggists. She bought arsenic again on the
6th of March, and it certainly is a very odd thing that she should
buy more arsenic when she came back on the 18th. Because
unless you are to take the account to be sure, that she used it
as a cosmetic, she has it before the 22nd, and that is a dreadful
fact if you are quite satisfied that she did not get it and use it for
the purpose of washing her hands and face. It may create the
greatest reluctance in your mind to take any other view of the
matter than that she was guilty of administering it somehow,
though the place where may not be made out, or the precise time
of the interview. But on the other hand you must keep in
view, that arsenic could only be administered by her if an interview
took place with L’Angelier, and that interview, though it may
be the result of an inference that may satisfy you morally that it
did take place, still rests upon an inference alone, and that
inference is to be the ground, and must be the ground, on which a
verdict of guilty is to rest. You will see, therefore, the necessity of
great caution and jealousy in dealing with any inference which you
may draw from this. Probably none of you may think for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that he did go out that night, and that without seeing her, and
without knowing what she wanted to see him about, if they met, he
may have swallowed 200 grains of arsenic on the street, and may
have carried it about. On the other hand, if he did not commit
suicide, keep in view that that will not of itself establish that the
prisoner administered the arsenic. The matter may have remained
most mysterious&mdash;wholly unexplained. You may not be able to
account for it on any other supposition, but still that supposition or
inference may not be a ground on which you can safely and satisfactorily
rest your verdict against the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Now then I leave you to consider the case with reference to
the views that are raised by this correspondence. I do not think
you will consider it so unlikely as was supposed that this girl, after
writing such letters, may have been capable of cherishing such a
purpose. But still, though you may take such a view of her
character, it is but a supposition that she cherished this murderous
purpose&mdash;the last conclusion that you ought to come to merely on
supposition and inference and observation on this wavering correspondence
of a girl in the circumstances in which she was placed.
It receives more importance, no doubt, when you find the purchase
of arsenic just before she expected, or just at the time that she
expected L’Angelier. But still these are but suppositions. Now
the great and invaluable use of a jury after they direct their
attention seriously to the case with the attention you have done, is
to separate firmly&mdash;firmly and clearly in your own minds&mdash;suspicions
from evidence. I don’t say that inferences may not be
completely drawn, but I have already warned you about inferences
in the ordinary matters of civil life, and in such a case as this.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
If you cannot say, ‘We satisfactorily find here evidence of the
meeting, and that the poison must have been administered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
her at that meeting,’ whatever may be your suspicion, however
perplexing may be the probability against her, and however you
may have to struggle to get rid of it, you perform your best and
bounden duty as a jury to separate suspicion from truth, and to
proceed upon nothing that you do not feel established in evidence
against her.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">After retiring for half an hour, the jury by a majority in

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“At the request of Messrs. W. B. Huggins &amp; Co., of this city,
we, the undersigned, made a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the body
of the late M. L’Angelier, when the appearances were as follows:&mdash;The
body, viewed externally, presented nothing remarkable, except
a tawny hue on the surface. The incision made on opening the
belly and chest revealed a considerable deposit of subcutaneous
fat. The heart appeared large for the individual, but not so large
as, in our opinion, to amount to disease. Its surface presented,
externally, some opaque patches, such as are frequently seen on
the organ without giving rise to symptoms. Its right cavities
were filled with dark fluid blood. The lungs, the liver, and the
spleen appeared quite healthy. The gall-bladder was moderately
full of bile, and contained no calculi. The stomach and the intestines,
externally, presented nothing abnormal. Being tied at
both ends, it was removed from the body. Its contents, consisting
of about half a pint of dark fluid resembling coffee, were
poured into a clean bottle, and the organ itself was laid open along
its great curvature. The mucous membrane, except for a slight
extent of the lesser curvature, was then seen to be deeply injected
with blood, presenting an appearance of dark red mottling, and its
substance was remarked to be salt (soft?), and easily torn by
scratching with the finger-nail. The other organs of the abdomen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
were not examined. The appearance of the mucous membrane,
taken in connection with the history as related to us by witnesses,
being such as, in our opinion, justified a suspicion of death having
resulted from poison, we considered it proper to preserve the
stomach and its contents in a sealed bottle for further investigation
by chemical analysis, should such be determined on. We,
however, do not imply that, in our opinion, death may not have
resulted from natural causes, as, for example, severe internal congestion,
the effect of exposure to cold after much bodily fatigue,
which we understand the deceased to have undergone. Having no
legal authority for making this <i>post-mortem</i> examination, we restrict
it to the organs where we thought likely to find something to
account for the death.</p>

<p class="psh"><i>SECOND</i> POST-MORTEM OF THE EXHUMED BODY,</p>

<p class="pc"><i>April 3, 1857.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“By virtue of a warrant from the sheriff of Lanarkshire, we, the
undersigned, proceeded to the <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the body
of M. L’Angelier within the vault of the Ramshorn church on the
31st of March ultimo, in the presence of two friends of the deceased.
The body being removed from the coffin, two of our number,
Drs. Thomson and Steven, who examined the body on the 24th
ultimo, remarked that the features had lost their former pinched
appearance, and that the general surface of the skin, instead of the
tawny or dingy hue observed by them on that occasion, had become
rather florid. We two likewise remarked that, with the exception
of the upper surface of the liver, which had assumed a purplish
colour, all the internal parts were little changed in appearance;
and we all agreed that the evidences of putrefaction were much less
marked than they usually are at such a date&mdash;the ninth day after
death, and the fifth after burial. The duodenum, along with the
upper part of the small intestine, after both ends of the gut had
been secured by ligatures, was removed and placed in a clean jar.
A portion of the large intestine, consisting of part of the descending
colon and the sigmoid flexure, along with a portion of the
rectum, after using the like precaution of placing ligatures at both
ends of the bowel, was removed and placed in the same jar with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the duodenum, and a portion of the small intestine. A portion of
the liver, about a one-sixth part of that organ, was cut off and
placed in a clean jar. We then proceeded to open the head in the
usual manner, and observed nothing calling for remark beyond a
greater degree of vascularity of the membranes of the brain than
ordinary. A portion of the brain was removed and placed in a
fourth clean jar. We then adjourned to Dr. Penny’s rooms, taking
with us the vessels containing the parts of the viscera above
mentioned. The duodenum and portion of small intestine were
found together to measure thirty-six inches in length. Their
contents poured into a clean glass measure were found to amount
to four fluid ounces, and consisted of a turbid, sanguinolent fluid,
having suspended in it much flocculent matter, which settled
towards the bottom, whilst a few mucus-like masses floated on
the surface. The mucous membrane of this part of the bowels
was then examined. The colour was decidedly redder than natural,
and this redness was more marked over several patches, portions
of which, when carefully examined, were found to be eroded.
Several small whitish and somewhat gritty particles were removed
from its surface, and being placed on a clean piece of glass, were
delivered to Dr. Penny. A few small ulcers, about the one-sixteenth
of an inch in diameter, and having elevated edges, were observed
on it, at the upper part of the duodenum. On account of the
failing light, it was determined to adjourn till a quarter past
eleven next day&mdash;all the jars, &amp;c., being left in the custody of
Dr. Penny. Having again met at the appointed time, we proceeded
to complete our examination. The portion of the largest intestine,
along with the portion of the rectum, measuring twenty-six inches
in length, being laid open, was found empty. Its mucous membrane,
coated with an abundant, pale, slimy mucus, presented
nothing abnormal, except on the part lining the rectum, on
which were observed two vascular patches, about the size of a
shilling. On decanting the contents of the glass measure, we
observed a number of crystals adhering to its interior, and at the
bottom a notable quantity of whitish sedimentary matter. Having
now completed our examination of the various parts, we finally
handed them all to Dr. Penny.</p>

<p class="pch">ON THE QUANTITY OF POISON FOUND IN THE STOMACH
OF A PERSON MURDERED BY ARSENIC.</p>

<p class="psh"><span class="smcap">Extract from Letter from Professor Christison to the</span> <i>Edinburgh
Medical Journal</i>, <span class="smcap">December</span>, 1857.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The purpose of the present brief communication is to state a
case which annihilates the defence of the prisoner, so far as the
large quantity of arsenic found in the stomach of the deceased may
have been thought to support it.</p>

<p>“Dr. Mackinlay, of Paisley, very lately reminded me of a case of
poisoning with arsenic, in which we were both concerned in 1842.
A person came under a charge of poisoning with arsenic, and was
indicted. But, on account of some informality, this indictment
fell to the ground, and the trial was necessarily delayed. Meanwhile,
during the delay, the general evidence was thought defective,
and the trial was dropped. There could be no doubt, however,
that murder had been committed. The arsenic was administered
in whisky-punch with sugar, the arsenic being kept in suspension
by constant stirring. The person survived at least five, possibly
seven, hours, and frequently vomited a yellowish or greenish liquid.
Nevertheless, I found a little spirit in the contents of the stomach;
and I collected thirty grains of arsenic in substance from the
stomach and its contents.</p>

<p>“Drs. Mackinlay and Wylie, of Paisley, who examined the dead
body, and also discovered arsenic in the stomach, had scraped off a
quantity of the powder of this substance from the inside upon a
watch-glass. I was not made aware at the time how much had
been thus obtained; but Dr. Mackinlay now informs me that the
quantity was sixty grains. Here, then, is a case exactly like that
of L’Angelier. Ninety grains of arsenic, and this in substance,
were found within the stomach alone. If to this be added, as in
Dr. Penny’s analysis in L’Angelier’s case, the probable arsenic dissolved
and suspended in the contents of the stomach, and that
imbibed by the textures of the stomach itself, it is impossible to
estimate the total quantity in the stomach at less than 100 grains.
But there was also arsenic in the intestines; and, indeed, it had
actually caused purging.</p>

<p>“How large a quantity, then, must have been given in that
instance! How strangely easy is it for a determined designing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
murderer to administer secretly those large quantities of a substance,
whose weight should render it difficult to be mixed, and
whose roughness should betray its presence when abundant!
How difficult for the stomach to discharge it by vomiting. I
draw no conclusion as to the question of Madeline Smith’s
innocence or guilt. In common with the public at large, I am
well satisfied that she escaped condemnation. But, as I have
been supplied, through the kindness of Dr. Mackinlay, with the
means of completing a fact, closely touching a ground of defence,
which, at the time it was brought forward, I regarded as hypothetical
and baseless, and which may be made much of again, were it
allowed to stand, as it has hitherto done, I have thought it my
duty to make the true state of the question known.”</p></div>

<p class="pch">L’ANGELIER’S DIARY.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>At the close of the fifth day, after putting in the bulk of the
letters, the Lord Advocate proposed to read entries in L’Angelier’s
pocket-book from the 16th of February to the 14th of March, 1857,
in support of the first and second charges. They were undoubtedly
in his own handwriting, and statements of what he did on those
days. It was objected that the book was not regularly kept, that
the corroborative evidence was not sufficient, and that two of the
entries were contradicted by witnesses who had been examined.
The Court took time to consider, and on the next morning
delivered the following judgments.</p>

<p><i>The Lord Justice Clerk.</i>&mdash;“The admission of hearsay evidence was
an established rule in the law of Scotland, but under those restrictions
and conditions, which went in many circumstances to its entire
rejection. What was now proposed to be admitted was this&mdash;certain
memoranda or jottings made by the deceased, in which
certain things were said to be contained, which went directly to
the vital part of this charge. The Dean of Faculty felt so
strongly that he did not scruple to state what the purport of one
of these was, in order to show the immense materiality of the
point. It was certainly most important for the Court to take care
that the rules of evidence were not relaxed merely because it
appeared that the matter tendered was of the highest importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
to the case. Before evidence could be received and allowed to
go to a jury, it must be shown that such evidence was legally
competent to be tendered against the prisoner. That was the rule
also in civil cases. It was of vital importance in considering
whether this evidence was admissible, to ascertain in what circumstances,
and, if possible, from what motive, and at what periods these
entries were made. Now it was a most remarkable fact that there
was no entry regarding the prisoner, or the circumstances connected
with her, before the 14th of February; and at that very time the
purpose on her part of breaking off the engagement with him and
of demanding her letters back had been communicated to the
deceased; and his purpose and resolution not to give up the letters
and to keep her to her engagement were avowed and made known,
as it appeared from evidence prior to that date. Then he had a
purpose in writing these memoranda&mdash;a purpose obviously to
strengthen his hold over the prisoner, not only by refusing to give
up the letters at that time and afterwards, but probably with the
view to hold out that he had a diary as to their interviews and
communications, so as to endeavour to effect his object of preventing
the marriage, and of terrifying her into giving up her engagement
with Mr. Minnoch. He (the Lord Justice Clerk) made this observation
not merely with regard to the weight and credibility of these
entries, but with regard to their admissibility; because in the
case of hearsay evidence one could ascertain from the witnesses
the time the statement was made, all the circumstances and all
the apparent motives which could be collected as to the statement
being made by the deceased. But when we could not know with
certainty the motive with which the man made the entry, or,
perhaps, as in this case, could perceive reasons why he made the
entry as against her, intending to prejudice her in one way, not
of course with reference to such a trial as this, but with reference
to her engagement, he thought it could not be said that this came
before the Court as a statement recorded by him as to indifferent
matters, or as to matters in which he might have not had a strong
purpose in making the statement. Further, it might be a record
of a past act. He felt the force of what the Lord Advocate had
said, that supposing in this book there had been an entry that this
man purchased arsenic, would not that have been available in favour
of the prisoner. An illustration of this point had been suggested
to him by a person whose authority and experience were of
the very highest. Take an action of divorce against the wife
where the paramour was dead; would an entry in any diary of his
that he had enjoyed the embraces of this woman on such a night in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the absence of her husband be proof against the wife? He thought
not. What was proposed in this case was to tender in evidence a
thing altogether unprecedented, according to the research of the
Bar and the Bench, of which no trace or indication occurred in any
book whatever, viz., that a memorandum made by the deceased
should be proof of the fact against the panel in a charge of murder.
He was unable to admit such evidence; it might relax the sacred
rules of evidence to an extent that the mind could hardly contemplate.
One could not tell how many documents might exist
and be found in the repositories of deceased persons; a man might
have threatened another, he might have hatred against him, and be
determined to revenge himself, and what entries might he not make
in a diary for this purpose? He had a faint recollection of a case
in 1808&mdash;the trial of a man Patch for murdering Page, or of Page
for murdering Patch&mdash;in which some letter of the murdered man,
prior to his death, was used; but he had been unable to find the
case, and he had no notion if it was of the character he had alluded
to. However, in the meantime, as the point was perfectly new, and
as it would be a departure from what he considered to be an
important principle in the administration of justice, he thought
this evidence could not be received.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Handyside.</i>&mdash;“The special point is, whether the entries of
certain dates&mdash;two in number&mdash;are to be read and made evidence
for the prosecution, as regards the first and second charges in the
indictment. The whole of these entries have been written with a
lead pencil. I notice this to make the observation that ink and
penmanship afford to a certain degree a means of ascertaining
whether entries are made <i>de die in diem</i>, thus having the character
of entries made daily; or, on the contrary, of several entries
having the appearance, by change of ink or of pen, of being made
at one time, and so after recollection. Where all the entries are
in pencil, there can be no security as to the time when the
entries are, in point of fact, inserted, and that they are not <i>ex post
facto</i>; or that the original entries have been expunged, and others
substituted in their place&mdash;whether this be a correction of memory,
or with purpose and design of another character. The party
making such entries in pencil has entire power over what he has
done or chooses to do.” Then alluding to the fact that no authority
for such evidence could be found, which entitled the objector
to the evidence to throw on the tenderer the burden of showing
that it ought to be received, the learned judge continued&mdash;“I
think the question one of great difficulty&mdash;at least I have found it
so. Had the writer of the memorandum been living, they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
not have been made evidence&mdash;of themselves they were nothing.
They might have been used in the witness-box to refresh the
memory, but the evidence would still be parole. What would be
regarded would be the oath of the witness to the facts, time and
person; and if distinct and explicit, though resting on memory
alone, the law of evidence would be satisfied, irrespective of any
aid by memorandums and letters, though made at the same time.
It is the oath of the witness to the verity of his oral statement in
the box which the law requires and regards. But if the writer has
died, is this circumstance to make such memorandums thenceforward
admissible as evidence by their own weight? Are they,
the handwriting being proved, to be treated as written evidence?
That would be a bold proposition. Death cannot change the
character originally impressed on the memorandums, and convert
them from inadmissible to admissible writings. They are private
memorandums, seen by no eye but the writers as such, subject
to no check upon the accuracy of their statements, whether arising
from innocent mistakes or from prejudice or passing feeling. I do
not say that they are to be supposed false and dishonest, for the
idea is repugnant, from the consideration that it would be idle to
falsify and invent when memorandums are intended to be kept
secret by the writer. But it is quite conceivable that vanity might
lead to statements being made wholly imaginary, with a view of
the subsequent exhibition of the book, and were its admissibility
as evidence set up by death, it might become a fearful instrument
of calumny and accusation. I speak just now of private memorandums,
diaries, and journals, taken in the abstract. As to other
writings of a deceased person, such as letters, I do not say these
may not become admissible as evidence by reason of death, though
during life they could not be used. They thus become analogous
to words spoken&mdash;to representations made and conversations
held&mdash;by a deceased person, the proper object of hearsay evidence.
It was contended that the principle on which hearsay evidence is
admitted would extend to anything written by a deceased person.
It is assumed to be a declaration in writing of what if spoken
would have been admissible on the testimony of the person hearing
it. And on the first view it would seem that the written mode is
superior to the oral, from the greater certainty that no mistake is
committed as to the words used. But this would be a fallacious
ground to rest on, for words written would require to be taken without
explanation or modification; whereas words spoken to another are
subject to the further inquiry by the party addressed as to the meaning
of the speaker in order to a better and more thorough understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of the subject of communication, the object of making it, and the
grounds on which the speaker’s statements rest. And all these
things may be fought out in the examination of the witness who
comes into court to give this hearsay evidence. The value of
hearsay evidence, and the weight to be given to it, come thus to
depend much on the account which the witness gives of the circumstances
under which the communication was made to him, as to
the seriousness of the statement and what followed upon it in the
way of inquiry and reply. Now a mere writing in the way of a
memorandum or entry in a book in the sole custody of the writer
till his death can be subject to no such tests. Its very nature
shows that it is not intended for communication. It may be an idle,
purposeless piece of writing, or it may be a record of unfounded
suspicions and malicious charges, treasured up by hostile and
malignant feelings in a moody, spiteful mind. These views impress
me strongly with the danger of admitting a private journal or
diary as evidence to support a criminal charge. I think the question
now before us must be decided as a general point. As such I
take it up. If I were to confine myself to the special and peculiar
circumstances of this case, I should see much perhaps to vindicate
the court in the reception of the evidence tendered. There is to
be found in the letters which have already been made evidence
much to give corroboration or verification to some at least of the
entries in the pocket-book. But I feel compelled to close my mind
against such considerations, and to look above all to a general and,
therefore, safe rule by which to be guided. I have come, therefore,
to be of the opinion that the production tendered as evidence in
the case in support, as I take it, of the first and second charge,
ought to be rejected.”</p>

<p><i>Lord Ivory</i> said the opinions just delivered had relieved his mind
of a burden of responsibility under which he laboured, and which
he was ill able to bear. He had given the most anxious, serious,
and repeated consideration to this matter. He had found little or
nothing in the way of authority, and no dicta so precisely bearing
on the case as to be of any avail. But judging in the abstract,
applying the rules as applied to other cases, endeavouring to find a
principle by comparison of the different classes and categories in
which evidence had been distributed and in which it had been
received, he felt himself totally unable to come to a conclusion
that the evidence of this document should be excluded from the
jury. As his opinion could not in the least degree influence the
judgment, he should be sorry to add anything that would even
seem to be intended to detract from the authority of the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
now given; least of all should he be disposed to follow such a
course in a capital case, where the judgment was in favour of the
prisoner. He would content himself, therefore, with simply
expressing his opinion. It appeared to him that this document
should have been admitted <i>valeat quantum</i>, and that the jury
should have considered its weight, and credibility, and value.</p></div>

<p><i>For the Defence</i>: Mr. Clarkson, <i>by the intervention of the Sheriffs of London

<p class="p1"><i>Ann Merritt</i> was indicted for the murder of her husband,
James, by poison, at Clapton, on the 25th of January.</p>

<p>Merritt, who was a turncock in the employ of the East
London Waterworks, had been at work in his usual health,
with the exception of a slight cold, on Wednesday, the 23rd
of January. When, however, a fellow-workman called upon
him about nine the next morning, he was told by the prisoner
that her husband was sick in the yard, and in a minute or
two afterwards Merritt came in and told his comrade that he
had been drinking some broth and a cup of hot tea upon it,
and expected that it had turned his stomach. They started
off to work, and on the way Merritt complained of being very
thirsty, and went into a public-house and had some rum-and-water
before they separated for their respective jobs. He
seems, however, to have soon returned home unwell, as
between ten and eleven a neighbour (Mrs. Gillett), who lived
next door, who had been previously called in by eight o’clock
in the morning, saw the deceased in his house very ill, and
the prisoner emptying some thick gruel into a basin from a
saucepan, and pouring water on it. The gruel had been made
from oatmeal fetched from a corn-chandler’s by the witness’s
son, at the prisoner’s request, who had given as a reason for
making it that her husband had returned so very thirsty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
This gruel the deceased was seen eating at a quarter past
eleven, and very soon after vomiting. However, at one o’clock,
Merritt went out again to work with his comrade, but soon
after felt so sick and ill that he asked his friend to do his
work for him, and returned home. When his friend returned
to Merritt’s house with his tools, between five and six in the
evening, the prisoner told him to go upstairs and see “Jem,”
as he was very ill, and wanted to see him. This witness
went up to the deceased’s bedroom, followed by the prisoner,
and found Merritt in bed complaining of being very sick,
feeling cramp in his limbs; at which the deceased said, “he
did not wonder, as what with the weather and the work they
had to do, it was enough to kill a horse.” No more was seen
of the parties until half-past nine at night, when Mrs. Gillett
was again called in by the prisoner, and found the husband in
bed retching violently, and complaining of a burning pain in
his chest and stomach. Between ten and eleven Mr. Toulmin,
the doctor, was called in, and at half-past twelve the husband
died.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toulmin</i>, a general practitioner at Clapton, was first
examined. He was called in between ten and eleven on the
Thursday night, and found the deceased in bed sick, complaining
greatly of pain in his stomach and cramps in his
legs, his pulse very weak, and his skin below the natural
temperature; he prescribed for him, and left. Subsequently
he made a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the body on the 28th,
by the coroner’s order, with the assistance of Mr. Welch, a
neighbouring surgeon, to which the prisoner at first objected.
When the stomach was opened, it contained a <i>thickish matter
slightly pink</i>, which was poured into a stoppered bottle and
sent with the stomach to Dr. Letheby for analysis. On its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
coats there were red spots, such as are observed in persons
who have died of irritant poison.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Henry Letheby</i>, professor of chemistry at the London
Hospital, to whom the stomach and its contents had been
forwarded, gave the following evidence, which, in consequence
of the dispute which subsequently arose on his statement as
to the time at which the fatal dose was taken, is given in
full:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I first experimented,” said the witness, “on the contents of the
bottle (the fluid found in the stomach), and detected 8½ grains of
white arsenic. By one course of experiments I reproduced the arsenic
in a metallic form&mdash;it is in this tube (produced). The earthen
jar contained part of a human stomach. I noticed a peculiar appearance
in it, which I have noticed in cases of poisoning by arsenic&mdash;<i>there
was a small portion of whitish powder adhering to the lining
of the stomach</i>, too small a quantity to enable me to ascertain what
it consisted of. I then examined the intestines that were in the
jar; I subjected them to a chemical analysis, and the result was
the detection of a very small quantity of arsenic. There was also
in the jar a part of a human liver. I subjected about a quarter of
a pound of it to experiment, and obtained a quantity of metallic
arsenic (produced); <i>it was too minute a quantity to weigh</i>. That in
the stomach was the only quantity I weighed; that would be
sufficient to cause death. I had the opportunity of witnessing a
case where 2½ grains killed; the general quantity would be
8 grains; I look upon that as an average dose. It would generally
be fatal. Vomiting is almost invariably the consequence of arsenic
introduced into the stomach. A person attacked by that would be
likely to throw up a portion of the arsenic. Looking at the
quantity I found, and the parts in which I found it, <i>in my
judgment the arsenic I found had been taken not more than two or three
hours before death</i>, but that is a matter of opinion; a dose might
have been given before. It would depend upon many circumstances
how soon it would find its way into the liver.”</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined.</i>&mdash;<i>Question.</i>&mdash;“About two grains of arsenic you
say would cause death; do you mean taken together?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, or less; 2½ grains have done so. I know
nothing of this transaction but from the examination. I found a
very small portion in the liver, perhaps one tenth of a grain in a
quarter of a pound. A liver weighs about 5 pounds, and supposing
the arsenic to be equally diffused, there would be twenty times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
that quantity&mdash;equal to 2 grains. <i>My observation with reference
to the time it had been taken was in reference both to the stomach and
the liver.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Are the data at all safe?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; I will tell you why. I found in the stomach
8½ grains of arsenic, and there was not much in the intestines.
<i>I conclude, therefore, that there had not been time for it to have passed
into the intestines, which would have been the case if it had been taken
long before death. But there was only a trace in the intestines, so I
conclude that it was taken a very short time before death.</i> That
furnishes datum to me to form a judgment on the subject of hours.
Food remains five hours before it passes into the intestines. I am
able to say that the contents of the stomach pass into the intestines
in four, eight, or ten hours, from experiments I have performed on
living subjects. <i>I have not the least doubt.</i> I saw the intestines;
they were in the jar. They did not appear to have been influenced
by arsenic; they were slightly red, and there were traces of
arsenic. I have reduced something that was in the intestines
into a metallic state. I experimented on it, and found it was
arsenic. It was destroyed in the experiment to which I was
obliged to submit it to prove it was arsenic. It was not likely
that I should find it in the liver without some being in the
intestines. The time would not depend on the constitution of the
person. Digestion depends upon the constitution, but I am
speaking of the average. Digestion is more or less rapid according
to the constitution of the person who has received the subject
matter. I have heard of cases in which matters which would not
digest have remained three or four days, but those were solid
matters. <i>I think liquids pass into the stomach</i> (<i>intestines</i>?) <i>under all
circumstances in five hours as</i> (<i>after</i>?) <i>they are imbibed.</i> There is a
valve which prevents solid matters from passing into the stomach
till they are digested. <i>The arsenic was in a liquid state, all except
a little white powder on the side of the stomach.</i> I am obliged to have
recourse to an average to form an opinion as to how long it would
take. We have no means of dealing with an independent case
except by an average.”</p>

<p><i>By Mr. Bodkin, Q.C.</i>&mdash;<i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What did the contents of the
stomach look like?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Thick gruel. They were filtered, and I examined
the filtered portion, <i>and my opinion is that the arsenic had been taken
two or three hours</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p></div>

<p class="psh">PURCHASE OF POISON BY THE PRISONER.</p>

<p>This was proved by the son of a chemist of the name of
Brown, of whom the prisoner purchased two pennyworths of
arsenic on the 19th of January, which, at her request, he
enclosed in two separate papers, each marked “poison,” as
she said that one of them was for her sister who lived some
distance off. The papers had something of the appearance of
those of effervescing powders.</p>

<p class="psh">CONDUCT AND STATEMENTS OF THE PRISONER.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gillett</i> gave some remarkable evidence as to the
statements and conduct of the prisoner during the night of
her husband’s fatal illness and after his death.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“When the prisoner called me in a little after nine in the
evening, I found her husband in bed retching violently, and I gave
him water half-a-dozen times, and then went for Dr. Toulmin. At
five o’clock that day the prisoner said she was going for the doctor,
to tell him to send her husband something for the bile, but that he
did not want her to do so. A second time during the evening she
told me she wanted to do this, and that he would not let her, and
that she had applied to a neighbouring doctor, but that he had
refused to come, and only sent some pills. After her husband died
she said, ‘How true were Dr. Toulmin’s words,’ that, ‘when her
husband once took to his bed, he would go off like the snuff of a
candle.’” [Dr. Toulmin had no recollection of ever having made
such a statement.] “Next day the secretary of the Benefit Society
to which her husband belonged called and had some conversation
with her. Before that she had spoken to me about the Benefit
Society, and said if her husband died she should have the full
benefit of it. On the day of the <i>post-mortem</i> she asked me if I
had asked Dr. Toulmin what was the cause of death, and I said,
from what I heard, it was poison; when she said, ‘Do you think I am
guilty?’ I replied, ‘I do not doubt you.’ Then she walked about
in an agitated manner and appeared distressed. On the day of the
inquest she said to me, ‘You know, Mrs. Gillett, that Annie (her
little girl) ate the rest of the gruel.’ I said ‘Don’t say so; I did
not see any of you eat it.’ She said, ‘If I did not <i>Ashby</i> did, and
he ought to be the first witness’ (<i>Ashby</i> said he did not see the
deceased or anyone eat it). On the day of the adjourned inquest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
she asked me if poison had been found, and when I said ‘Yes’
she said ‘I am innocent; he was a good husband, and it is not
likely I should do such a thing. Dear creature; if that is the
case he has done it with his own hands.’ I replied ‘It is not
likely, as he purchased a new pair of boots the morning before his
death.’ Whilst we were talking <i>Andrews</i>, the summoning officer,
came in, and she said to him ‘Mrs. Gillett knows that I ate the
rest of the gruel,’ and I replied ‘I know nothing about it, or who
ate it.’<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> On the 31st of January in her house she said to me ‘Do
you think if I had any hand in his death I should not have let him
live to to-day and then have received the full benefit from the
society.’”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><i>On cross-examination</i> the witness protested that she had repeated
these conversations before, and was almost certain she had done so
before the coroner and the magistrate. When she said ‘I did not
doubt her,’ she meant that she had not the slightest suspicion of
her guilt. The witness had introduced the subject of the burial
club. The prisoner was kind and affectionate to her husband, and
attentive during his illness, and much distressed. The witness
had heard the deceased complain of the difficulties into which his
wife had plunged him, and on the Monday before he was taken ill
they had quarrelled.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Other statements of a most unfavourable character were
improperly extracted from her by <i>Coward</i>, the inspector of
police. As the Lord Chief Baron said, with well-deserved
reproof, he had evidently prepared a proceeding, and framed
certain questions, which would enable him to observe the
demeanour of the prisoner when she was confronted with a
witness ready in attendance, in order to give his own view of
her conduct afterwards to the jury.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I,” said this witness, “saw the prisoner on the 2nd of
February in her house, and told her I had come to ask a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
questions, which she might answer or not as she pleased, but that
it would be my duty to repeat her answers to the magistrate;
that I should like to have some women present to hear, and accordingly
sent for two of her neighbours, and when they had come
I asked her ‘Did she know of any arsenic being in the house?’
‘No.’ ‘Did her husband use it in his business?’ ‘No.’ ‘Had
she purchased any lately?’ ‘No.’ <i>Brown</i> was then brought in,
and she turned pale and agitated. I told her <i>Brown</i> had told me
she had, and she said ‘That was true, and she would tell me what
for.’ On the way to the police court she said ‘she purchased it
for herself, but thought better of it afterwards.’ I asked her what
had become of it afterwards, and she said ‘she had emptied it into
one paper.’ She then changed the conversation, and said that her
husband was very fond of soda and acid powders, and that a woman
had told her that he had said he was very troubled in his mind,
and did not know whether he should not jump into the river or
Clapton pond.”</p>

<p><i>On cross-examination</i> he excused the presence of the women, on
the ground that he wanted to see if <i>Brown</i> could identify the
prisoner; that she wanted to say more but that he stopt her, and
told her to tell the magistrate.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Of this last statement of the inspector, the Lord Chief
Baron added in his charge&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“That it appeared to him to be a piece of hypocrisy, which
accorded with all the rest of his conduct. He wished it to go forth
to the public, and that the police themselves should understand,
that such proceedings savoured of an excess of zeal which was
perfectly unjustifiable, and which ought not to be looked on in any
other light than discreditable.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">To <i>Clarke</i>, a police constable, she said, whilst in custody,
that “she supposed she should be hung&mdash;they had told so
many lies about it&mdash;she bought the arsenic for her husband.”
To the female searcher at the police-station she said that she
did not know on what charge she was brought there; and
then, when told it, added, “I know he was poisoned, but not
by whom.” And when told that <i>Mrs. Gillett</i> was the principal
witness against her, declared that she was forsworn.
On the second examination at the police-court, she told the
gaoler that “she wished the magistrate to know something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
about the case. All she had said was true, except as to not
buying the poison. She had placed it in the same cupboard
with her husband’s powders after taking off the papers marked
‘poison.’ If he had taken it, it must have been by mistake,
and she threw the remainder of the poison and all his powders
into the fire. She intended to have taken it herself if he
went on as he had done.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE PRISONER’S STATEMENT.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have nothing to say except that I never intended my husband
to take the poison. When I bought it I intended to take it myself,
if he had come home as he had done several times before. I could
not live with him had he gone on so. I thought no more of it till
the Sunday, when I thought he might have taken it instead of the
soda, and then I burnt it. What I said about hanging was this&mdash;‘If
I am to be hanged this moment I am innocent of anything to
my husband.’ I have nothing more to say.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Clarkson</i>, for the defence, after alluding to the difficulties
under which he laboured in consequence of the
prisoner not having made any preparations for her defence,
and the brief having only been handed to him as the case
was opened, attacked the evidence of Coward in language
which the Lord Chief Baron entirely adopted, and asked the
jury to dismiss it from their consideration. He also characterised
the declarations of the prisoner as told by witnesses
clearly unfavourable to her. “With regard to the testimony
of Dr. Letheby, if they relied on it, it would be necessary,”
he said, “to come to the conclusion that the prisoner had
continued administering poison to the deceased during the
whole of the day&mdash;as it was proved that he was ill as early as
eight in the morning. But he asked the jury if her conduct
would justify such a conclusion. Her story might be true,
and if the deceased took the poison through her culpable
negligence in putting it in the cupboard with his soda
powders, the offence would not be murder, but manslaughter.”</p>

<p>The strong remarks of the Lord Chief Baron on the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and evidence of Coward have already been given, and as the
remainder of his charge consisted only of an analysis of the
evidence, and its application to the different points of the
case, it is needless to report it. As was characteristic of this
kind judge, every point that could be made in favour of the
prisoner was brought clearly out in his able charge. After a
brief deliberation, a verdict of guilty, coupled with a recommendation
to mercy on account of her previously good character,
was returned, and sentence of death was pronounced by the
learned judge.</p>

<p>A medical man of large experience, who was present during
the trial, was so astonished at the statement of Dr. Letheby
as to the time when the arsenic had been administered, that he
communicated with the sheriffs, who brought the case before
Sir George Grey, by whom it was referred to Sir Benjamin
Brodie, Dr. Billing, Dr. Leeson, and other medical men of
repute. These, it was understood, agreed that the time of
administration could not be fixed. On this, at the urgent
request of Dr. Pereira, Dr. Letheby wrote to the Home
Secretary that it was his duty to admit that it was within the
range of possibility&mdash;nay, even probable&mdash;that the arsenic
might have been taken, as the woman asserted, early in the
morning of her husband’s death, and in consequence the
capital sentence was commuted for one of penal servitude for
life. This case was used by Mr. Bright in his speech in the
House of Commons in favour of the abolition of capital
punishments, as a strong example of their danger.</p>

<p>How much more satisfactory would it have been could a
court of appeal have reheard such a case instead of its being
left to the Home Secretary’s judgment of evidence known only
to himself.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name “arsenic” is applied to two things: in chemistry
it means the element As; in popular usage it signifies the
oxide As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In our report, the element will be called
<i>arsenicum</i>, the oxide simply “arsenic” or “white arsenic.”</p>

<p class="psh">ARSENICUM,</p>

<p>Symbol As, is an element of steely metallic lustre, tarnishing
to dull dark grey, met with in crystalline (rhombohedral)
fragments, so brittle that they can be easily reduced to a dark
grey powder, insoluble in water, but slowly absorbing oxygen
and dissolving, insoluble in pure hydrochloric and in vegetal
acids, and in alcohol, soluble (by oxidation) in strong sulphuric
and in nitric acid, in chlorine, in solution of bleaching
powder. Tasteless, and inodorous until heated, when it sublimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
without melting, at 110° C. (Guy), and gives a strong
<i>odour of garlic</i>. Sp. gr. 5·8. The characters of the metal
are utilized in Marsh’s and other tests, hereafter described.
Heated in air, it oxidizes to white fumes of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. It is
employed chiefly to harden lead in making <i>shot</i>, in the proportion
of 0·3 per cent. The use of these in cleaning bottles,
&amp;c., may contribute a trace of As: the presence of a larger
amount of <i>lead</i> would in this case indicate the source.
Common Britannia metal, used for teapots, spoons, &amp;c., often
contains As. It occurs also in many minerals.</p>

<p>When oxidized it is poisonous, but <i>pure arsenicum</i> passes
through the body of animals unaltered (Wagner’s Chem.
Technology, trans, by Crookes, 1872, p. 86). The vapour is
very poisonous.</p>

<p>Arsenicum has two oxides, the trioxide and the pentoxide.</p>

<p class="psh">ARSENICUM TRIOXIDE.</p>

<p><i>Synonyms.</i>&mdash;Arsenious oxide, arsenious acid, arsenious
anhydride; popularly, “arsenic,” “flour of arsenic,” or
“white arsenic:” in mining districts it is sometimes called
“mercury:” Latin, acidum arseniosum.</p>

<p><i>Chemical formula</i> As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or two atoms (150 parts by weight)
of arsenicum, to three atoms (48 parts by weight) of
oxygen.</p>

<p><i>Forms.</i>&mdash;(1.) <i>Crystalline</i>. By sublimation and slow condensation
on moderately heated surfaces, also by deposition
from solution, we obtain regular <i>octahedra</i>, often so modified
as to appear like equilateral triangular or hexagonal plates, or
even elongated into triangular prisms, but never in the form
of regular <i>tetrahedra</i> such as tartar emetic yields. For
figures, see Guy and Ferrier’s Forens. Med., 1881, pp. 440
and 670. The crystals are transparent and highly refracting.
Sp. gr. 3·69. Volatilizes without melting, except under
increased pressure.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Amorphous</i> or <i>vitreous</i>. Suddenly cooled, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> condenses
as clear transparent drops, finally cohering into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
glassy mass, sp. gr. 3·74. When kept, this becomes opaque,
perhaps owing to a change into the crystalline variety, constituting
the “porcellanous” form found in commerce. If
the lumps be broken, layers of still transparent As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> will be
seen.</p>

<p>The <i>solubility</i> depends on the variety, temperature, length
of time it is digested, fineness of powder, &amp;c. So that exact
figures cannot be given, as hardly two authorities agree. It
is certain, however, that the amorphous form is less soluble
than the crystalline.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The accepted statement is that given
by Taylor (Med. Juris. 1, 250): that digested with cold
water, from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>500</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> dissolves, equal from one half to one
grain per fluid ounce; if boiled for an hour and allowed to
cool, an average of twelve grains per fluid ounce remains in
solution; if boiled for a shorter time, less is dissolved. See
also Woodman and Tidy’s Forens. Med., 1877, pp. 133, 134.
Organic matter is said to decrease its solubility; I have not
found that it does so to any notable extent. Dr. Blondlot
(Med. Times and Gazette, Feb. 11, 1860) states that fats,
such as bacon, diminish the solubility; this must be by
coating the particles and preventing contact with water.
Powdered white arsenic in all cases refuses for a long time to
become moistened by water, floating on the top, and collecting
in little lumps as if greasy: the appearance is so peculiar as
to have led sometimes to its detection. Commercial powdered
white arsenic is generally the opaque form pulverized, but it
may be crystalline.</p>

<p>As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is very soluble in potash and soda and their
carbonates, forming <i>arsenites</i>. It is less soluble in ammonia.
In hydrochloric acid it dissolves easily, forming <i>chloride of
arsenic</i>. It is less soluble (1 in 2,000) in alcohol than in
water. One part dissolves in 200,000 of chloroform. It is
insoluble in pure ether. It is heavy to feel, <i>tasteless</i>, very
faintly acid to test paper, and so feeble in affinity that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
soluble salts are strongly alkaline, and are decomposed by all
acids with separation of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The powder and its vapour
are inodorous, but when heated with charcoal or organic
matter it is reduced to arsenicum, with its odour of garlic.</p>

<p><i>Uses and Occurrence.</i>&mdash;1. As a preservative against
insects and fungi, for steeping seed-wheat. Many accidents
have resulted. Birds poisoned by it and afterwards eaten by
man have occasioned severe symptoms. From 1830 to 1840
in France 235 accusations of arsenic poisoning occurred, of
which 110 were against agricultural persons, proving that the
use of the drug in farming gives dangerous facilities for crime.
Sulphate of copper, or, better, a mixture of sulphate of soda
and lime, are more effectual as preservatives, and the latter
mixture is not poisonous. (Lancet, 1849, Jan. 20.)</p>

<p>2. For preserving skins and furs (arsenical soap). This
use has also caused serious results in the operators. Stuffed
birds, &amp;c., kept in living rooms may prejudicially affect the
inmates by giving off arsenical dust.</p>

<p>3. As an antiseptic it is injected in solution through the
vessels of subjects for dissection. Of course in this case the
body would show signs of the anatomical examination it had
undergone. In the trial of Professor Webster for the murder
of Dr. Parkman, at Boston, U.S., March, 1850, the <i>absence</i>
of arsenic and other preservative substances in the corpse
proved that it had not been a subject for dissection.</p>

<p>4. In glass making and the production of opaque white
enamels. Here most of the vapour passes up the chimney
and is diffused.</p>

<p>5. Some of the patent preparations for preventing “fur”
in boilers have contained alkaline arsenites.</p>

<p>6. Formerly wicks of candles were steeped in arsenic
solution to prevent a long “snuff” forming. Moreover, it
was incorporated with the candle itself to improve its
appearance. The result was a constant diffusion of arsenic
vapour in the room. Tapers were also coloured with emerald
green (copper aceto-arsenite), which likewise gave rise to
arsenical fumes. These objectionable practices have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
fortunately given up, owing to the strong representations of
scientific men.</p>

<p>7. Wood is sometimes preserved by a solution of arsenic,
and then tarred. This use would be practically free from
danger, except to the operatives.</p>

<p>8. An alkaline arsenite is used for washing sheep to destroy
vermin. The workmen sometimes suffer. (Lancet, 1857,
p. 281.) Streams have been poisoned, the solution has been
drunk in mistake (Ibid, 1856, p. 447), and lastly, the sheep
themselves have been killed (Taylor’s Med. Juris., i. 272).
Carbolic acid would probably answer better.</p>

<p>9. Cupric arsenite (Scheele’s green) and aceto-arsenite
(Schweinfurth or emerald green) are used as pigments.
In one case, where a baker’s shelves had been painted with
this colour, emerald green was found adhering to the bottoms
of the loaves (Med. Times and Gaz., 1854, p. 326). Blancmange
(<i>R.</i> v. <i>Franklin &amp; Randall</i>, Northampton, 1848<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>),
ornaments on cakes (Lancet, 1849, Feb. 17th), sweets,
dresses, and artificial flowers (Husemann, Jahresbericht, 1872,

toys,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> wrappings for chocolate, &amp;c., wafers, water and oil
colours, and wall papers have all been coloured with emerald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
green. Whenever such things have been swallowed, <i>the green
colour is seen in the vomit</i>. Boxes of paints should never be
given to young children. Cakes of emerald green and of
other poisonous colours have often been sucked or eaten with
fatal result; they are the more tempting as they are generally
made up with honey or glycerine. Bright green wall papers
have gone out of fashion, still many of the dull colours have
emerald green in their composition. Such papers certainly
give off arsenical dust, even if they do not evolve arseniuretted
hydrogen or other arsenical gas, and the symptoms they produce
have been well authenticated. In a new house the papers
should always be tested. Messrs. Woollams, of Marylebone
Lane, were, I believe, the first to disuse arsenical pigments in
paper-hangings.</p>

<p>These arsenites of copper give, with a little ammonia, a
blue solution (due to the copper), in which a crystal of silver
nitrate becomes covered with a yellow coating of silver arsenite.
The As can also be easily found by the other tests.</p>

<p>Dr. Raseden of Mersberg finds that arsenical papers cause
rheumatic pains, neuralgia, cough, lassitude, and emaciation
(Lancet, 1849, April 7th). They also cause skin eruptions.
These effects disappear when the patients are removed. In
Germany the use of these pigments is prohibited; it should
be so in England. Unfortunately no other permanent green
colour is so bright in tint.</p>

<p>The copper arsenites are insoluble in water, but soluble in
acids, hence are dissolved by the gastric juice, and then
absorbed.</p>

<p>10. In medicine, arsenic is used for skin diseases, ague,
and as a tonic; externally for cancer and lupus. <i>Liquor
arsenicalis</i> B.P., Fowler’s solution, or “ague drops,” is
composed of arsenic 80 grains, potass, carbonate 80 grains,
water 1 pint, flavoured with lavender. It is a solution of
potassium arsenite. <i>Liquor arsenici hydrochloricus</i> is arsenic
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, giving arsenic trichloride, of
the same strength as liquor arsenicalis. Among unofficial
preparations are “<i>Donovan’s Solution of Arsenic</i>,” containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
mercuric and arsenious iodides; strength 0·69 grain
<i>arsenicum</i> per fluid ounce: “<i>Davidson’s Cancer Remedy</i>”
equal parts of arsenic and hemlock (Dr. Paris): “<i>Cancer
Paste</i>,” containing 8 per cent. of arsenic, with cinnabar and
dragon’s blood: “<i>Hydrophobia Pill</i>,” <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> grain arsenic,
with 1 grain pepper, an absurd remedy much used in the
East Indies. (Blyth’s Pract. Chem., 1879, p. 376.) The
pharmacopœial preparations of arsenic acid will be described
under <i>arsenic pentoxide</i>.</p>

<p>11. It is given by grooms to horses, to render their coats
sleek, and improve their wind, under the name of “condition
balls or powders” (strength 2½ to 5 per cent. of arsenic),
also for worms, and as a tonic.</p>

<p>12. For destroying the nerves of decayed teeth, about
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub> grain is placed in the cavity. In the Lancet a case is
recorded in which inflammation and caries of the jaw followed
this practice, which is a very dangerous one.</p>

<p>13. In the manufacture of some aniline dyes, and in the
reduction of indigo, arsenic is often used. Dyed stockings,
&amp;c., have caused skin irritation, supposed to be due to
arsenic, but more probably owing to the dye itself.</p>

<p>14. Firework preparations commonly contain some compound
of As, and therefore give poisonous vapours. “Bengal
light” consists of 24 of potass. nitrate, 7 of sulphur, and
2 of realgar (arsenic disulphide). See also Blyth, Prac.
Chem., p. 379.</p>

<p>15. <i>Rat Poisons</i>:&mdash;No. 1. Arsenic 6 per cent., made into
a paste, with equal parts of flour and suet, variously coloured
and scented. No. 2. Equal parts of arsenic and carbonate
of barium (itself poisonous), coloured with rose pink, and
scented with oils of anise and rhodium.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>. “Fly water,” a solution of arsenious acid, or
arsenite of soda or potash, of varying strength, sweetened
with sugar, treacle, or honey. (Med. Times and Gazette,
Sept. 13th, 1851.) Some also contain orpiment (arsenic
trisulphide).</p>

<p>16. For cleansing metals, arsenite of soda has been used
on account of its strong alkalinity. It is an absurd preparation
to use for this purpose, as washing soda or potash would
act better. In December, 1857, 340 children were poisoned
by water from a boiler that had been “cleaned” by this compound
(Taylor on Poisons, 2nd ed., p. 378). In 1863, a man
died from drinking beer out of a pot which had been thus
cleansed (Taylor, Med. Juris., 1, 273).</p>

<p>17. The well-known “arsenic eating” of Styria has been
ridiculed as impossible, but has yet been authenticated on
further examination. A Styrian wood-cutter was seen by a
medical man to eat a piece of arsenic weighing 4½ grains, and
next day another 5½ grains, yet remaining in his usual health.
It is also eaten by the natives of Ceylon (Med. Times and
Gaz. 1862, p. 454, and 1866, p. 375). Workmen in arsenic
factories often become habituated to its influence. See a paper
by Roscoe, Mem. of Lit. and Phil. Soc. of Manchester, 1860.
I myself can testify to this fact. A student in the College of
Science, Dublin, was accustomed to take out of the arsenic
bottle little lumps about 3 or 4 grains each and eat them,
without apparent ill effect.</p>

<p>18. As a cosmetic, applied externally, it would probably be
useless. Unless the skin were abraded, or it remained very
long in contact, no absorption, and hence no poisonous effect,
would result, but any scratch or wound would be dangerous.
(See Christison’s Evidence, case of Madeline Smith, p. 320.)
And if in protracted contact with the skin, it will cause symptoms.
(Memoirs of Lond. Med. Soc., ii., 397, Amer. J. of
Med. Science, July, 1851.)</p>

<p>19. A solution of chloride of arsenic has been employed
for “bronzing” metals. The fumes would be highly pernicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>20. Ritter, of Rouen, states that glucose or starch-sugar
frequently contains arsenic, derived from the sulphuric acid
employed in its manufacture being made from arsenical
pyrites. He finds that by this means the arsenic is introduced
into <i>beer</i> brewed with glucose, into confectionery,
syrups, liqueurs, &amp;c. (Reimann’s Färber Zeitung, No. 3,
1878.)</p>

<p>21. It is said that certain paper collars and cuffs which
are extensively made in America have proved poisonous from
containing a considerable proportion of arsenic. (Les Mondes,
Nov. 11th, 1880.)<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>22. <i>Speculum Metal</i>, for telescope mirrors, is an alloy of
copper, tin, and 3 per cent. of arsenic.</p>

<p>23. In America, a paper soaked in a solution of arsenic
and other drugs is burnt, and the smoke inhaled for asthma
and bronchitis. (Year Book of Pharm., 1873, p. 345.)</p>

<p>24. Traces occur in mineral waters.</p>

<p class="psh">SULPHIDES OF ARSENIC.</p>

<p><i>Orpiment</i>, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, Auripigmentum, or King’s Yellow, trisulphide
of arsenic, obtained by precipitating a solution of
arsenic with sulphuretted hydrogen, is a yellow inodorous
powder, insoluble in water and in hydrochloric acid, but
slowly oxidizing in air to arsenious acid, and therefore
poisonous. It is found native. By heat it melts to a reddish
liquid: if air be excluded, it volatilizes at about 700° C.,
and condenses unchanged: if air be present, it is oxidized to
sulphur dioxide and arsenic trioxide, which condenses in the
crystals before-mentioned. It is soluble in alkalies and their
carbonates, and reprecipitated by hydrochloric acid. Commercial
“King’s Yellow,” formerly used as a pigment, but
now replaced by Chromate of lead, is a very poisonous mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> and As<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub>. It is sometimes employed in printing
indigo. A mixture of orpiment, water and lime is used in
the East as “Rasma” (see page 320) for a depilatory. In a
corpse, by putrefaction, the arsenic is frequently converted
into sulphide.</p>

<p><i>Realgar</i>, the disulphide, As<sub>2</sub> S<sub>2</sub>, is red, exists as a mineral,
and is also made artificially for fireworks. It contains <i>about</i>
75 per cent. of arsenic, but varies. Formerly it was used as
a pigment, and in tanning to remove hair.</p>

<p>These sulphides have rarely been used for criminal purposes.
<i>Orpiment</i> was employed by Mary Ann Burdock,
1833.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Being insoluble, they would only be absorbed after
oxidation into As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>. Ossikovszky (J. Pract. Chem. 2, xxii.,
323) finds that this change happens rapidly in contact with
organic bodies. But the opposite change, by putrefaction
and development of sulphuretted hydrogen, of As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> into
As<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub>, is far more likely and frequent.</p>

<p class="psh">ARSENIC ACID</p>

<p>is obtained by oxidizing As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> by nitric acid. It is a white
deliquescent solid, inodorous, <i>very soluble in water</i> to a
syrupy solution, which is corrosive, strongly acid and metallic
in taste. By heat it first gives the pentoxide, As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub>, then it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>breaks up into As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> and oxygen, finally completely volatilizing.
It is said to be less poisonous than As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>. (Wöhler
and Frehrichs, Ann. Chem. Pharm., lxv., 335.)</p>

<p>The <i>arsenates</i> are very like the phosphates. Like them
they give with acid molybdate solution a yellow, with magnesium
sulphate a white crystalline, precipitate. But with
sulphuretted hydrogen, after acidifying, they give <i>slowly</i> a
yellow precipitate of sulphide of arsenic and sulphur; and
with silver nitrate a <i>liver brown</i> precipitate of silver arsenate.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Sulphurous acid reduces arsenic acid to arsenious.</p>

<p><i>Sodium arsenate</i> is in the British Pharmacopœia, and is
employed in calico printing. A brominated solution of potassium
arsenate (strength = 1 per cent. As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) is used in
Russia for epilepsy. “Pearson’s solution” is 1 grain sodium
arsenate to 1 oz. water. “Macquir’s neutral arsenical salt”
is a binarsenate of soda. “Papier Moure” consists of paper
soaked in solution of potassium arsenate (Tidy).</p>

<p>Fischer (Ber. deutsch. Chem. Gesellschaft, xiii., p. 1778)
proposes <i>ferrous chloride</i> as better than sulphurous acid for
reducing arsenic acid to arsenious (see process for separation,
post).</p>

<p><i>Arsenic Trichloride</i>, As Cl<sub>3</sub>, is a volatile, colourless liquid,
very pungent, and fuming in air. It has been discarded from
medical use on account of its dangerous properties. A case
of poisoning by it is mentioned in Taylor (Med. Juris. 1,
p. 278). It is obtained in the process for separation from
the organs. Arsenic Triiodide, a dull red crystalline solid, is
used in ointments.</p>

<p><i>Arseniuretted hydrogen</i>, As H<sub>3</sub>, is a colourless gas of a
garlic odour, almost insoluble in water. It burns with a
livid bluish-grey flame, forming water and a white cloud of
As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>. By heating to redness it is decomposed into hydrogen
and a deposit of arsenicum (the “mirror”). It is formed
whenever hydrogen is evolved in contact with arsenic compounds,
hence has caused accidents in making hydrogen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
impure zinc. It is probably the most deadly compound of
As, and proved fatal to its investigator, Gehlen, and in
several other cases.</p>

<p class="psh">EXTRACTION AND TESTS.</p>

<p>If arsenic has been given in the solid form, the greater
part will remain insoluble, and will be found either in lumps
or powder in the stomach, or as a white powder adhering to
its lining. Any substance so found should be washed with
water and tested for arsenic. It is absurd to say, as Dr.
Letheby did in Ann Merritt’s case (<i>ante</i>, p. 366), that the
quantity was too small for examination: if a white powder
can be <i>seen</i>, it can be <i>tested</i>. In the contents, or in any fluid
food, the heaviness of powdered arsenic will cause it to readily
separate as a sediment. Soot or indigo, the legal admixtures,
should also be sought.</p>

<p>Arsenic is not naturally present in the body (Sonnenschein,
Gerichtlich. Chemie, p. 122; and others). As it occurs in
soils, in cases of disinterment a portion of the earth surrounding
the coffin should be tested.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>When absorbed, it may pass into every part of the body,
but more especially into the liver and spleen. De Poncy and
Livon have supposed that it was capable of replacing phosphorus
in the actual brain substance (Comptes Rendus, 23,
June 9th, 1879), and that it is mainly localized in the <i>brain</i>.
Another author finds it concentrated in the <i>bones</i>. Prof. E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Ludwig of Vienna, in the case of a woman who suffered from
making artificial flowers coloured with magenta containing
arsenic, found arsenic in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and
stomach, but not in the bones or urine (Lond. Med. Record,
Dec. 15th, 1877, p. 509). He found also that in human
beings as well as dogs poisoned with arsenic, in both acute
and chronic cases, the liver contained the largest amount, the
kidneys sometimes a considerable quantity, and the bones,
brain and urine, only small traces (Jahresb. für Thierchemie,
1879, 85). These results have been discussed by Johnson
and Chittenden (American Chem. Journal, 2, 332), who, in a
woman poisoned by arsenic, found, <i>a year and a half after
burial</i>, over 5 grains of As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, almost evenly distributed.
The conclusion to be drawn is, that, of the absorbed arsenic,
the main part will be in the liver, and the rest in varying
proportions in other tissues, so that as much as possible of
the whole body should be examined.</p>

<p>As the large quantity of organic matter is in the way of the
tests, it has been proposed to get rid of this by different processes.
That of Fresenius and V. Babo consists in oxidizing
the substances by strong hydrochloric acid and chlorate of
potash. There is a great objection to this, as loss is liable to
occur from volatilization of arsenic trichloride, unless it is
done in a retort, which is practically impossible on account of
the bulk and frothing, and the danger of explosion from the
oxides of chlorine formed.</p>

<p>The following modification of an old process has been found
by the author to be satisfactory. It may be used also for
antimony and mercury. Weigh the whole, cut up finely, and
grind the matters to a pulp with water, reserving a weighed
portion of about one third; render strongly alkaline with
potash or soda previously tested for arsenic. Pass in a current
of chlorine, <i>stopping before the alkalinity is destroyed</i>.
Boil the solution down to a low bulk, <i>not to dryness</i>, till a
portion taken out and treated with acetic acid gives no chlorinous
odour, showing that the hypochlorite has been completely
decomposed. Arsenic trichloride does not escape from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
alkaline solutions, so there is no loss. Add sufficient <i>pure</i>
aqueous sulphurous acid, to reduce the arsenic acid to
arsenious. Now transfer to a large retort provided with a
tube-funnel and condenser, the end dipping into water in a
well-cooled tubulated receiver, itself connected by a tube with
a flask containing dilute potash solution. Through the tube-funnel
pour in pure concent. sulphuric acid in volume about
equal to the liquid, adding it gradually, as there is much
heat and effervescence. Mix well by shaking, and distil
slowly from a sand bath. In distilling a moderately strong
solution of mixed arsenious and antimonious chlorides in
concent. hydrochloric acid, I have found that the arsenic all
comes over in the first third of the distillate, and that after
two-thirds have passed over, the antimony also begins to
distil. Hence, in the above process the distillation should
not be carried beyond half the volume of the liquid in the
retort, when all the arsenic, <i>in whatever form it originally
existed</i>, will be found as chloride in the receiver, except a little
which may have escaped into the potash. Test a portion of
the potash solution by Marsh’s or Reinsch’s process as hereafter
described: if any arsenic be present, add the remainder
to the liquid in the receiver, taking care that excess of free
acid is left. Pass into the distillate washed sulphuretted
hydrogen in excess (or add a solution of the gas in water),
warm, cover, and allow to stand. (The excess of sulphuretted
hydrogen may afterwards be removed by warming and passing
in carbonic acid gas.) If any arsenic be present, a yellow
precipitate of arsenious sulphide, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, will appear; if the
precipitate be pale, it will consist mainly of sulphur, formed by
the action of the sulphuretted hydrogen on the sulphurous
acid which is present. Some organic matters are also
generally present. Collect the precipitate on a filter, wash
with sulphuretted hydrogen water, dissolve in a dilute solution
of ammonium carbonate, and again precipitate with
hydrochloric acid. The precipitated arsenious sulphide is
now nearly pure: it may be collected on a small filter, washed
rapidly, again dissolved in ammonia, the solution received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
a porcelain dish, evaporated to a low bulk, transferred to a
weighed porcelain boat, and heated cautiously in a current of
carbon dioxide to a temperature not above 400° C., sufficient,
in fact, just to melt the arsenious sulphide. [Sulphur boils
at 446° C., As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> at 700° C.] Any remaining sulphur is thus
removed, and the arsenious sulphide may then be weighed. The
weight multiplied by 0·805 gives the amount of arsenic trioxide.</p>

<p>A less preferable way is to collect the arsenious sulphide
on a weighed filter, to dry, and dissolve out any sulphur by
carbon disulphide. Yet another method is to oxidize by
nitric acid, evaporate, precipitate the arsenic acid by a mixture
of ammonic chloride, magnesic sulphate, and strong
ammonia &mdash;“magnesia mixture”) as ammonio-magnesic arsenate,
and weigh, either as that salt, or, after ignition, as pyroarsenate
of magnesia. The former, dried at 100° C., contains
39·57, the latter 48·29 per cent. of As. Lastly, if the sulphide,
oxidized by nitric acid, be alkalized with ammonia,
and warmed to 70° or 80° C. with a solution of ammonium
molybdate in nitric acid, as used for the ordinary determination
of phosphates (see Fresenius, Qual. Anal., p. 54), a
yellow precipitate of <i>arsenomolybdate of ammonia</i> appears,
which can be weighed: it contains 3·3 per cent. of As (Bull.
Soc. Chem., Jan. 7th, 1877).</p>

<p>But where such importance may hang on quantities, the
use of weighed filters for such small amounts is simply courting
error. When the As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> has been weighed in the porcelain
boat, calculate it into As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or into As (it contains 61 per
per cent. of As), then cover it with a mixture of pure potassic
cyanide and sodium carbonate, place it in a piece of combustion
tubing drawn out at the end into a long thin point,
pass washed dry carbon dioxide over it, and heat cautiously till
all the water is expelled. Finally raise the temperature to full
redness, and pass a <i>slow</i> continuous current of the gas, keeping
the narrow part of the tube cool with moistened blotting
paper. The sulphide will be reduced to As, which will deposit
in a metallic coating on the narrow portion. Seal this part,
and preserve it as evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious that the residue in the retort may be tested
for other metals.</p>

<p>The presence of arsenic ascertained, and the quantity
known, it would seem as if nothing more was necessary.
Still, it is useful to confirm results by the other tests. The
reserved portion may now be divided and used as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh">MARSH’S TEST.</p>

<p>If hydrogen be evolved in presence of arsenical compounds,
it combines with the element to form “arseniuretted
hydrogen,” or <i>arsine</i>, AsH<sub>3</sub>, a colourless gas of alliaceous
odour, extremely poisonous, giving, when passed into silver
nitrate solution, a precipitate of silver and a solution of
As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; decomposed at a red heat into As and hydrogen,
and burning with a livid flame into As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and water. The
flame yields, when a cold surface, such as a porcelain crucible-lid
or dish, is depressed into it, a steel-grey lustrous stain or
ring of metallic arsenic.</p>

<p>To evolve the hydrogen, Marsh originally used zinc and
sulphuric acid. As it is so difficult to obtain zinc pure, magnesium
has been proposed. But the evolution is then too
rapid. Moreover, the reputed “pure” acids of commerce are
scarcely ever free from a trace of arsenic. This difficulty
affects equally the galvanic method. Hence it is better to
employ <i>sodium amalgam</i> (Edmund Davy, Chem. News, xxxiii.,
58, and ditto, 94). One part of sodium, scraped free from
oxide, is melted under solid paraffin, and gradually added to
ten parts of mercury (previously purified by nitric acid) with
constant stirring, the paraffin poured off, and the amalgam
cleaned by washing with pure dry benzine. The result is a
solid crystalline alloy.</p>

<p>A few fragments of this alloy are placed with water in a
flask provided with a thistle funnel, and with a delivery tube
dipping into a 4 per cent. solution of silver nitrate. The
horizontal part of the delivery tube is heated to just below redness
by a lamp, meanwhile being supported to prevent its
bending. If, after about an hour, no As ring appears in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
tube, and if the silver nitrate, after precipitation of the silver
by hydrochloric acid and filtration, gives no arsenious sulphide
on addition of sulphuretted hydrogen, the amalgam is pure.
Now add to the flask the suspected liquid, put in more
amalgam, and continue the heating of the tube and passing of
the hydrogen till no further evolution of As occurs. The
portion of tube containing the deposit of As may be cut off,
weighed, the As dissolved off by aqua regia, and the tube
washed, dried, and weighed again. The silver nitrate solution
contains the remainder of the As dissolved as As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: after
removal of the silver by hydrochloric acid and filtration, the
arsenious acid solution may be divided, a portion titrated by
iodine (see Blyth’s Pract. Chem., p. 392), and the rest tested
qualitatively by sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonio-silver
nitrate, and ammonio-cupric sulphate (see these tests, <i>post</i>).</p>

<p>If the original liquid be rendered strongly alkaline before
adding the amalgam, no antimony will pass off with the
arsenic. But from <i>acid</i> liquids, arsenic and antimony pass off
together. They both give metallic rings in the tube, and
stains on a cold surface. The chief distinctions between them
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Arsenic.</i>&mdash;More volatile, hence deposited further from
the flame; bounded by a “hair brown” fringe of suboxide;
heated in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gives <i>yellow</i>
As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, unchanged by passing dry hydrochloric acid gas:
heated in air, it gives easily a sublimate of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in glistening
octahedral crystals. It is soluble at once in chloride of lime
solution.</p>

<p>2. <i>Antimony.</i>&mdash;Less volatile, hence forming close to the
flame; no brown fringe; heated in a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen, gives <i>orange or black</i> Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, volatilized by passing
dry hydrochloric acid; heated in air, it gives a white oxide,
volatile with great difficulty, and not generally crystalline.
It is insoluble in chloride of lime solution.</p>

<p>By the above process, Edmund Davy has detected one-millionth
of a grain of As; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> grain gives a very decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>effect in a few minutes. It is applicable not only to As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
but to all other arsenical compounds in powder, whether
soluble or insoluble. Organic matter interferes very little.</p>

<p>It must be observed that hydrogen alone may give a slight
reduction and precipitate in solutions of silver nitrate.</p>

<p>To prepare pure sulphuric acid and pure zinc, see Selmi,
Chem. Soc. Journal, May, 1881, p. 311.</p>

<p class="psh">REINSCH’S TEST.</p>

<p>If a fragment of pure copper be boiled with <i>pure</i> hydrochloric
acid for ten minutes, no discolouration occurs. If
now a solution containing arsenic be added, the copper turns
black or grey, from formation of an alloy of copper and
arsenicum. On drying the copper, and heating it in a small
glass tube closed at one end, the arsenicum is oxidized, with
production of crystals of As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>. Organic matter does not
interfere. <i>Antimony</i>, sulphides, and some metals produce a
similar grey deposit, but do not yield a <i>crystalline</i> sublimate.
<i>Mercury</i> also precipitates on the copper, but the sublimate
consists of metallic globules.</p>

<p>Any compound of arsenicum, mixed with dried potassium
cyanide and carbonate of soda, introduced into a piece of hard
glass tubing drawn to a point, and heated in a slow stream of
dry carbon dioxide, gives a deposit, in the narrow portion, of
the whole of its arsenic in the metallic form (Fresenius).</p>

<p>As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> heated in a tube with dry potassium or sodium
acetate gives <i>cacodyl-oxide</i> (Bunsen) of an exceedingly offensive
alliaceous odour.</p>

<p>In solution, arsenious acid gives:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>With ammonio-silver nitrate</i> (prepared by adding silver
nitrate to dilute ammonia till a precipitate just forms) a
<i>yellow</i> precipitate of silver arsenite, soluble in ammonia and
in nitric acid.</p>

<p>2. <i>With ammonio-cupric sulphate</i> (prepared by similarly
treating cupric sulphate), a <i>bright green</i> precipitate of cupric
arsenite.</p>

<p>3. With <i>sulphuretted hydrogen</i> a yellow colour (the intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of this has been proposed as a method of estimating small
quantities of arsenic by comparison <i>à la</i> Nessler), but no
precipitate till hydrochloric or other acid be added, when
<i>yellow arsenious sulphide</i> falls. This is a most delicate test,
as arsenious sulphide is only soluble to the extent of one part
in one million of water (Fresenius, Quant. Anal. p. 137), and
not much more soluble in acids. The precipitate may be
weighed, or treated as already mentioned (pp. 386-7). Tin and
cadmium solutions also give yellow sulphides, but they are
insoluble in ammonia, and do not yield the other tests.</p>

<p>4. Stannous chloride (protochloride of tin) gives a brown
deposit of metallic arsenic. With acids containing traces of
arsenic it gives a brown colour.</p>

<p class="psh">DOSES.</p>

<p>1. <i>Medicinal</i> (British Pharmacopœia).&mdash;Acidum arseniosum
(As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>), <sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> grain in solution. Liquor arsenicalis
(solution of potassium arsenite), 2 to 8 minims. Liquor
arsenicalis hydrochloricus (solution of chloride of arsenic),
2 to 8 minims. Sodæ arsenias (sodium arsenate), <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> to ⅛
grain. Liquor sodæ arseniatis (solution of the preceding),
5 to 10 minims. Ferri arsenias (ferric arsenate), <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> to ½
grain.</p>

<p>2. <i>Poisonous.</i>&mdash;Smallest recorded: <i>one grain</i>, (Lancet,
Dec. 16th, 1837), <i>two grains</i>, (Provincial Journal, 1848, p.
347); average smallest, 2½ grains. Recoveries have been
described after enormous doses, up to 1½ ounce, taken solid
and therefore not dissolved, rejected by vomiting or purging,
or prevented from irritant action by abundance of food (see a
case in the Lancet, Jan. 13th, 1849, when 1oz. was taken
with recovery).<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Idiosyncrasy may cause smaller doses to be dangerous; on
the other hand, habit may cause tolerance of the poison, as
already mentioned with regard to arsenic eaters. Nitre is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
said to increase the poisonous action (Med. Times, 1844, p.
216). Antimony by its prostrating action would have the
same effect.</p>

<p class="psh">PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.</p>

<p>The symptoms usually commence in ½ to 1 hour after
administration (Taylor), but vary with dose, form, &amp;c. They
have also been <i>immediate</i> (case of Lofthouse, York, 1835);
in ten minutes (Guy and Ferrier); in ¼ hour (Taylor); in
5, 7, 8, and 10 hours (Med. Gaz. xlvii. 722); in 23 hours
(Med. Times, Oct. 21, 1848); in <i>four days</i> (Woodman and
Tidy, Forens. Med. p. 134).</p>

<p>As to the character of the symptoms, <i>irritation of the
stomach and intestines</i> is the main feature. Burning pain,
vomiting and purging, cramps and occasionally tetanus (Orfila,
i., 449) occur. Rarely there is insensibility and no pain.
Great thirst, constriction of the throat, headache, and finally
exhaustion are common. Sometimes epilepsy or paralysis
has been caused. The truth is, that every variety of constitutional
disturbance may be caused by the violent irritation
of the alimentary canal, except that the intellect is rarely
affected. In many cases the effects closely resemble those of
acute diarrhœa or English Cholera. One anomalous case is
on record when death occurred in four hours after sound sleep,
and <i>no inflammation</i> of the stomach was found (Lancet, xii.,
194). For a detailed list of cases, see Guy and Ferrier’s
Forens. Med. p. 457.</p>

<p><i>Fatal period.</i>&mdash;Shortest, twenty minutes (Taylor); average,
about twenty-four hours. Death in three to eight hours is
common. But the end has been sometimes far more protracted,
even to <i>two years</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>, Med. Jur. i., 256).</p>

<p>The <i>vomit</i> is usually yellowish (L’Angelier) from bile:
occasionally it is tinged with blood; rarely white. If the
arsenic has been mixed with soot or indigo, these will affect
its colour.</p>

<p><i>Post Mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The lining membrane of the
stomach and intestines is almost always inflamed and reddened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
rarely darker from congestion. White patches, covered
with mucus, should be examined for solid arsenic. Perforation,
ulceration, and gangrene are rare. In bodies long buried,
the arsenic is often converted into sulphide by putrefaction,
and then appears as a yellow coating. Occasionally inflammatory
appearances are found in the mouth, throat and other
organs. Congestion of the brain is uncommon.</p>

<p>Among the effects of <i>chronic</i> poisoning by arsenic may be
noted inflammation of the eyelids (conjunctivitis), skin eruptions,
irritability of the stomach, jaundice, and local paralysis
(for cases see Taylor’s Med. Jur., i. 252).</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT AND ANTIDOTES.</p>

<p>Vomiting should be encouraged by emetics or tickling the
throat; the stomach pump being used if judicious. To
obviate the irritation, demulcents such as arrowroot, mucilage,
&amp;c., are useful. Albumen (white of egg) has proved
serviceable (Lancet, Jan. 13th, 1849). To render the arsenic
insoluble, magnesia or chalk may be given. But the best
chemical antidote is hydrated ferric oxide, freshly prepared by
precipitating ferric chloride or tinct. ferri sesquichlor. with
carbonate of soda (washing soda), or by similarly precipitating
ferrous sulphate (copperas), and then shaking the mixture
with air till it turns red, or by the following formula:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p class="p1">(Hoglan, Year Book of Pharm. 1881, p. 211).</p>

<p>M. Lucas of Beauvais has stated, that in nine cases of
arsenical poisoning, calcined magnesia arrested the symptoms
and eventually removed the effects (J. Chim. Medi. 1850).</p>

<p class="psh">REMARKS.</p>

<p>Arsenic has been given in pessaries by the vagina, in
ointment for skin diseases and by “cancer doctors,” also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
inhaled as vapour for asthma, in each case with dangerous
result.</p>

<p>The frequent occurrence of this poison in common articles
of use gives an opportunity to the defence which has led to
analyses of multitudes of articles&mdash;wall-papers, clothing,
cooking vessels, &amp;c. It may be positively affirmed that if
white arsenic <i>in the solid state</i> be found in the stomach, it
could not have come from any of these sources. The trace
that could be derived from wall-papers would be infinitesimal.
The tests for arsenic are almost inconveniently delicate, so
that the slightest impurity of the reagents will make it appear
to be present. Reichardt (Archiv. der Pharm., xiv. 1-23),
states that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> milligramme of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> evolved as arseniuretted
hydrogen will precipitate silver nitrate, and that by this means
he has found it in the urine of patients suffering from arsenical
wall-papers. The effect of such papers is certainly pernicious,
though it may be mentioned that in Silesia mortar is made
with arsenical sand, and people living in houses thus built do
not suffer (Lancet, 1849, April 7th). On the whole it may
be concluded that in a trial, <i>traces</i> of arsenic will not be
sufficient, a tangible quantity found and <i>weighed</i> will be the
only sufficient evidence of poisoning by the mouth.</p>

<p>To illustrate the value of a knowledge of chemistry to a
medical man in such cases the following may be quoted. A
child of ten was supposed to have eaten a quantity of meal
mixed with arsenic for rats. An emetic of sulphate of zinc
was given: the first vomit gave with ammon. sulphate of
copper a bright green, with ammon. nitrate of silver, a yellow
precipitate, thus establishing that the poison was arsenic.
Emetics and diluents were continued, then albumen was
given. Some hydrated ferric oxide was hurriedly made from
common green vitriol (ferrous sulphate) and ammonia: the
washed precipitate was administered in successive teaspoonfuls.
Recovery on the third day. In the vomit 10 grains of
white arsenic were found. (Lancet, 1849, p. 311.)</p>

<p>The following is a curious form of attempted poisoning.
A person lately presented this prescription in Paris:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
“Decoct. barley, 8 oz.; hydroch. acid, 1 drachm; <i>arsenious
acid, 10 grains</i>.” The signature of a physician was appended,
but, on suspicion being aroused, was found to be a forgery.</p>

<p>In Ann Merritt’s case, Dr. Letheby stated that arsenic had
been taken not more than two or three hours (afterwards he
said four) before death, because he found undigested gruel in
the stomach, containing arsenic <i>in solution</i>, and because the
intestines contained very little arsenic. This conclusion was
considered by weighty authorities to be rash, and probably
wrong, because:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. He found 2 grains (a poisonous dose) in the liver. This
could hardly have got there within so short a time.</p>

<p>2. In a stomach irritated by arsenic or disease, food may
remain undigested for seven, eight, or more hours.</p>

<p>8. A previous dose of arsenic, adherent to the coats of the
stomach, might be dissolved by an influx of warm gruel.</p>

<p>4. The portion in the intestines might have been evacuated
by purging.</p>

<p>5. The “pinkish liquid” described by the surgeon who
performed the <i>post-mortem</i>, pointed to admixture with blood,
therefore to inflammation of some standing, and certainly did
not tally with Dr. Letheby’s description of “gruel.”</p>

<p>With reference to the alleged administration of arsenic in
cocoa in Madeline Smith’s case, the following details will be
illustrative.</p>

<p>100 grains of white arsenic were found to be a small teaspoonful,
not heaped. This quantity was mixed with two
teaspoonfuls of Epps’s cocoa. The colour was rendered
lighter, but still looked natural. On making up with boiling
water and milk, as directed, a cup of cocoa was obtained, in
which neither appearance, taste, nor smell, betrayed anything
unusual. On standing the milk rapidly curdled, and the
arsenic deposited, but this would not be seen in an opaque
cup. With arrowroot or gruel a similar result was obtained.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been stated that arsenic trioxide volatilizes with the
vapour of water. I have not found this to be the case to any
appreciable extent, but it does volatilize slowly at 100° C.,
and still more at 120°. About ½ gramme of As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> lost, after
six hours on the water-bath, 3 per cent. of its weight; after
six hours at 120° C. it lost six per cent. When chlorides
are present, as in the body, it is still more liable to volatilization
as arsenic trichloride. Hence matters containing it
cannot be boiled down or dried without danger of loss, unless
previously rendered alkaline.</p>

<p>R. Otto has stated that ordinary sulphuretted hydrogen
may contain arsenic from the sulphate of iron used. He proposes
to prepare the gas by the action of pure hydrochloric
acid on pure calcium sulphide obtained by roasting gypsum
with charcoal (Ber. Chem. Ges. xii. 250). I have tested
water into which sulphuretted hydrogen has been repeatedly
passed, and have found no arsenic: if really present in the
gas, the As H<sub>3</sub> is not absorbed in the liquid.</p>

To the relevancy of the indictment several objections were
taken, but overruled, and the prisoner pleaded “Not Guilty.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p><i>Edward William Pritchard</i>, a native of England, and
member of the Royal College of Surgeons since 1846, before
he came to Glasgow, had been a traveller in the Polar and
Pacific Seas, and in the countries bordering the Mediterranean,
and first set up in practice at Filey, in Yorkshire, where he
married the daughter of a Glasgow silk merchant, by whom
he had a family. In consequence of this connection, about
1859 he removed to Glasgow, where, from his writings on
several diseases, he became favourably known as a person of
superior attainments, and gradually obtained a fair practice.
Whilst thus apparently in the enjoyment of popularity and
success, he, in 1863, became the subject of much adverse
report, from the suspicious circumstances attending a fire in
his house, by which a maid servant was killed&mdash;the Insurance
Company refusing to pay his claim, and the doctor not taking
legal steps to enforce its recovery. The ugly rumours about
this affair, however, gradually subsided, and his social and
professional position was retained, until the sudden death of
his mother-in-law, whilst staying in his house to nurse his
sick wife, was quickly followed by that of the wife herself.
As the mother-in-law was 70 years of age, the statement that
she had died of apoplexy was at first accepted. When, however,
the death of the wife so quickly followed, suspicion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
excited, inquiries were instituted by the police, and on the
21st of March, 1865, Dr. Pritchard was arrested on the charge
of poisoning her. A <i>post-mortem</i> examination of her remains
had proved that her death had not been due to natural causes,
and a subsequent examination of the body of his mother-in-law,
exhumed for the purpose, led to the same result in her
case. Chemical analyzations of the interior portions of both
bodies disclosed in that of the wife the presence of antimony
in sufficient quantities to account for her death; and in that
of the mother-in-law to reduce the powers of her constitution
so far as to increase and facilitate the effects of a narcotic
poison.</p>

<p class="psh">THE SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p>The details of the progress of the lingering illness of Mrs.
Pritchard until her death, and of the sudden seizure of Mrs.
Taylor with what proved to be a fatal attack apparently of
apoplexy, were given in great minuteness by several non-professional
witnesses, servants in the house at the time, pupils
of Dr. Pritchard’s, and a girl whom Dr. Pritchard had seduced
and promised to marry when his wife died.</p>

<p>Up to October, 1864, Mrs. Pritchard, never apparently a
very strong woman, had been in her usual state of health.
Towards the end of that month, however, she began to look
pale and lose her strength from frequent vomitings, and had
to keep her bed, as she believed, from a severe cold, for four
or five days. About this time, on her temporary recovery, she
went on a visit to her parents in Edinburgh, and there gradually
recovered, returning home about Christmas in her former
state of health. After a week or so the vomiting returned,
and on the 1st of February, 1865, she had a severe attack of
cramp. Some few days after, as the prisoner said, Dr.
Cowan, a relative, saw her, and prescribed small doses
of champagne as a stimulant. However, the vomiting returned,
and about midnight on the 8th she was seized with
such a violent attack of cramp that, at her request, Dr.
Gairdner was called in, who at once stopped all stimulants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Dr. Pritchard told every one that his wife was suffering from
gastric fever. Dr. Gairdner, however, could not find any
feverish symptoms, and based his advice on their absence,
confessing himself “puzzled with the case.” On the 10th
Mrs. Taylor, her mother, came from Edinburgh to nurse her
daughter. She was a hale, hearty woman, though 70 years of
age, but at times affected with severe headaches, as a remedy
for which she had been accustomed for some years to have
recourse to Battley’s sedative solution. On the 13th, at her
suggestion, some tapioca was bought, brought into the house,
and left for some time on the lobby table. Of this, afterwards,
a cupful was made, and fetched by Mary McLeod, the
younger servant, and by her carried up to her mistress’s bedroom.
Whether Mrs. Pritchard partook of this or not was
not known, but Mrs. Taylor ate a portion of it, and the cook
tasted it before it left the kitchen. Both Mrs. Taylor and the
cook were violently sick after taking the tapioca, the old lady
saying that she feared she was suffering from the same complaint
as her daughter. The tapioca had not been tampered
with when purchased, but when the remainder of it was
analysed it was found to be charged with nearly five grains of
tartarised antimony. On the 16th the old cook left, and
Mary Patterson came. She found her mistress suffering from
continual vomits, and gradually getting weaker&mdash;as Mrs.
Taylor said, “one day better, and two days worse.” For the
next twelve days this state continued, and then a dreadful
scene occurred. Mrs. Taylor, who, whilst at Dr. Pritchard’s,
had sent for a bottle of Battley’s solution, was violently sick
in the evening of the 24th of February, and about nine on
that night rang the bell violently, and was found by the servant
vainly endeavouring to vomit and asking for hot water to
assist her. By the prisoner’s orders this was twice brought,
and when on the second occasion Mary Patterson entered the
room Mrs. Taylor was sitting in her chair with her head down,
apparently insensible, and with her eyes closed. She was
lifted into bed, and died in about three hours. Whilst
dressing her corpse a bottle, about two-thirds full of Battley’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
solution, was found in her pocket, and identified as that which
she had last purchased. That this also was pure and free
from poison when sold was clearly proved. When, however,
it was analysed, it was found to be charged with antimony
and aconite. Dr. Pritchard declared that she had died of
apoplexy following on paralysis; but Dr. Paterson, who had
been called in at the last moment, distinctly declared that there
were no such symptoms. An attempt was made by the
prisoner to get Dr. Paterson to give the usual certificate of
the cause of death, and on his indignant refusal, the prisoner
himself filled up the form with the words, “Paralysis for
twelve hours, followed by apoplexy,” and the first victim was
buried.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchard still lingered. She had been sick on the
day before her mother’s death, but not for two or three days
afterwards. Then, however, the attacks returned, coming on,
as before, within an hour or two after her meals, which were
uniformly sent to her by her husband&mdash;generally by the hands
of McLeod. It was during the last three weeks of her
miserable existence, that on one occasion he sent to her from
the supper table a small bit of cheese, which McLeod tasted
at Mrs. Pritchard’s request, when it gave her a burning
sensation in the throat, and made her thirsty. At another
time he sent her a jug of camomile tea, after taking a wine-glass
of which, from time to time, as ordered, she uniformly
vomited. At another time, he had some egg-flip prepared
for her in the kitchen, and brought down the pieces of sugar
for it, taking them, as the witness believed, into his consulting
room, where he kept his drugs and poisons, before he put
them into the glass. Patterson, who tasted it, was struck
with the taste, and Mrs. Pritchard, who drank it, was sick
very soon after, and in the following night. In the week in
which Mrs. Pritchard died she drank some port wine which
Dr. Pritchard had sent up, and again was sick. On the 17th
of March, the day before she died, Patterson, who had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
up to her bedroom to speak about some linen, found Dr.
Pritchard handing his wife a glass of porter, which she
drank. At that time Mrs. Pritchard was in her senses.
About five o’clock the bell rang violently. McLeod called
Patterson to come up at once. She did so, and found her
mistress raving about her mother, and calling on them to
leave her and assist Mrs. Taylor; her hands severely cramped&mdash;speaking
wildly about her children. After her hands had
been rubbed, Mrs. Pritchard seemed to get more calm, and
Mary Patterson left, having handed the patient’s supper to
her husband. Until about half-past one the next morning
Patterson heard nothing. Then she was called up by McLeod
to get a mustard poultice, which the latter took up to the
bedroom, and in a few minutes after the bell again rang
violently. She hurried up, and found the prisoner in bed by
his wife’s side. Her mistress was dead. The long agony of
months was at an end.</p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF THE MEDICAL ATTENDANTS.</p>

<p><i>Dr. James Moffat Cowan</i>, her second cousin, in consequence
of a letter from the prisoner, saw Mrs. Pritchard on
the 7th and 8th of February. She was then in the drawing-room,
and complained of great irritability of the stomach,
combined with an inability to keep down her food, and
vomiting for some time back. He visited her rather as an old
friend than as a professional man, recommended her to go to
bed, and advised small quantities of champagne with ice to
be taken at intervals, and as she expressed a desire for food,
recommended her husband to try injections of beef tea. She
was seized with vomiting during the evening, but when he
saw her before he left on the following day, seemed better,
and he never saw her again alive. He spoke to the apparent
happiness in which she lived with her husband, and to the
fact that, after her death Dr. Pritchard, to enable the servants
to take a last look at their mistress, had the coffin opened.
Mrs. Taylor, with whom he was intimately acquainted, Dr.
Cowan described as a person of very temperate habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dr. William Tennent Gairdner</i>, who was sent for during
the night between the 8th and 9th of February, immediately
after Dr. Cowan left, was told by the prisoner that for some
time his wife had suffered from sickness and spasms, and
that Dr. Cowan had recommended stimulants, and that she
had had champagne and chloroform.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I found her,” said the witness, “in bed, lying on her back,
with a considerably flushed face, and in a state of pretty considerable
excitement. She told me of Dr. Cowan’s previous visit and
of her wish that I should be sent for, and we had a good deal of
general conversation about her symptoms. I found her to a
certain extent exhausted, but by no means extremely so. She had
a pretty good pulse. There was nothing in her symptoms to
indicate immediate danger, and the most remarkable thing about
her symptoms was the violent state of mental excitement she was
in and the spasms of the hands. She held her hands outside the
bedclothes above her head, and I saw that the wrists were turned
in, and the thumbs somewhat inverted towards the wrists&mdash;a very
peculiar state of the hand. I thought she was intoxicated from
the combination of champagne and chloroform. When I turned
to the fire to warm my hands before feeling her, she called me
very unfeeling, and begged me not to leave her, using expressions
for which I thought she was not responsible, from her temporary
intoxication. I then examined her belly, and asked particularly
if there was any chance of her being pregnant,&mdash;that being a
frequent cause of vomitings,&mdash;and found there was none; and,
after various inquiries, feeling her pulse and her skin, spoke
strongly against the use of stimulants, which I ordered to be at
once discontinued until I saw her again. Next day when I saw
her, she assured me that she felt better and had had no return of
the vomiting, but had still the remains of the spasms in her hands.
I repeated my injunctions of no stimulants or medicine, and that
her only food should be a plain boiled egg and bread and milk&mdash;that
is, nothing that could produce sickness or sit heavy on her
stomach. I told her that if her stomach had fair play it would
digest the simple food I indicated. <i>I was very much puzzled as to
what was the matter with her, and, had I been attending her as a
general practitioner, should probably have seen her once or twice a
day; but there was a doctor in the house, and my habit is to act as a
consulting physician, and not as a general practitioner.</i> I had to
leave town for a distant engagement, but before I left I wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Dr. Pritchard to inquire how his wife was, and received the reply
that she was better. I wrote also to her brother, Mr. Michael
Taylor, <i>as I was very much puzzled with the case</i>, and asked to be
backed up by him in forbidding the use of stimulants. On my
return Dr. Pritchard called, and left word that his wife was better,
and that I need not call again. I do not think that there was
any fever at all.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his <i>cross-examination</i> Mr. Clark, in consequence of Dr.
Pritchard having said to the witness that it was a case of
catalepsy, elicited that Dr. Pritchard was somewhat careless
in his nomenclature of disease&mdash;“that he spoke occasionally
a little at random, and was not a model of wisdom, accuracy,
and caution, in applying names to things;” and that, in
writing to her brother&mdash;who had been a fellow-student with
him&mdash;“he had not indicated to him that there had been any
foul play, but nothing more than improper treatment.”</p>

<p><i>Dr. James Paterson</i>, who gave his evidence with an apparently
strong feeling against the prisoner, a man of very
large experience, living within two hundred yards of Dr.
Pritchard’s house, had been called in a little before eleven on
the night of the 24th of February, to see the mother-in-law.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Dr. Pritchard,” said the witness, “met me in his hall, and
conducted me to the bedroom, telling me that his mother-in-law,
whilst in the act of writing a letter, had fallen off her chair on to
the floor, and been conveyed upstairs about half an hour before I
came. She and his wife, said the prisoner, had partaken of some
bitter beer for supper, and soon after both became sick and
vomited, and complained of its being more bitter than usual. From
the quantity remaining in the bottle they could not have taken
more than a third of a pint each.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> I asked in regard to the
previous state of his mother-in-law’s health, and particularly as to
her social habits, when he led me distinctly to understand that
she drank spirits occasionally. He also stated that his wife had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
been very poorly for some time with gastric fever, and that, some
days previously, he had telegraphed for her mother to come and
nurse her. On entering the bedroom I observed Mrs. Taylor lying
on the edge of the bed nearest to me on her right side, with all
her clothes on. She had all the appearance of a sudden seizure.
Mrs. Pritchard, in her night-dress and nothing on her head, and
her hair very much dishevelled, was in the same bed, but underneath
the clothes, sitting up immediately beyond her mother. Mrs.
Taylor was then alive, and she gave me the impression of a healthy-looking
old lady, and previously in very good health&mdash;rather
beyond the usual size, well-formed; a very superior-looking person,
not having the slightest appearance of being addicted to the use of
spirituous or intoxicating liquors. Her face was rather pale, but
the expression was calm and placid. The eyelids partially closed,
the lips rather pale and livid; the breathing slow and laborious;
the skin cool, and covered with a clammy perspiration; the pulse
almost imperceptible, and she seemed to me perfectly unconscious.
On my opening up the eyelids, I found both pupils very much
contracted. From these symptoms, and judging from her general
appearance, my conviction was that she was under the influence of
opium or of some other powerful narcotic, and I at once pronounced
my opinion that she was dying.</p>

<p>“I and Dr. Pritchard retired a little from the bedside, and went
to the fireplace, and I then stated distinctly that she was dying.
Pritchard said she had frequently had attacks of a similar kind
before, but never one so severe. I said, nothing that we could do
would have the slightest effect, but that, as a last resource, we
might try mustard poultices to the soles of the feet, the calves of
the legs, and the inside of the thighs, and as quickly as possible
administer a strong turpentine enema. Pritchard at once proceeded
to prepare the enema, and said he had a little before given
her one, in which he had administered a glass of brandy. The old
lady lay apparently comatose, or unconscious; but on being roused
a little, and the head and shoulders slightly elevated, there was a
degree of consciousness came on, and the pulse became perceptible
at the wrist. She had not manifested consciousness before. I
directed Pritchard’s attention to the pulse, and he then clapped
the old lady on the shoulder and said, ‘You are getting better,
darling.’ I looked at him and shook my head ominously, as much
as to say, ‘Never in this world.’ A slight fit of retching now came
on, and she put up a small quantity of a frothy kind of mucus,
immediately after which the ‘coma,’ or insensibility, returned&mdash;the
breathing became more oppressed, more laboured, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
alvine evacuations were passed involuntarily, I then concluded
that the case was hopeless, but Pritchard administered his enema.
I then left the room, and went downstairs with Pritchard to his
consulting room, and there repeated my opinion that she was in a
state of narcotism. Pritchard then said that the old lady was in
the habit of regularly using Battley’s Sedative Solution, and that
she had a few days before purchased not less than a half-pound
bottle of that medicine, and that he had no doubt, or it was very
likely, that she might have taken a good swig of it. I know that
medicine, but seldom use it. My impression was that she was not
what is called an opium-eater, or one that used opium to any great
extent. She presented no appearance of that.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">At this visit Dr. Paterson’s attention was forcibly attracted
to the appearances presented by Mrs. Pritchard.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“She seemed,” said the witness, “exceedingly weak and exhausted.
Her features were sharp or thin, with a high hectic
flush on her cheeks, and her voice was very weak and peculiar&mdash;in
fact, very much resembling a person verging into the collapsed
stage of cholera. The expression of her countenance conveyed to
me the idea of a kind of silly or semi-imbecile person at the time.
At first I was inclined to attribute her appearance to the recent
severe attack of gastric fever, which I was told by the prisoner she
had had, and her symptoms aggravated, of course, by the great
consternation and grief not unnaturally caused by the sudden and
alarming condition of her mother. At the same time I must say
that I could not banish from my mind the idea, or rather conviction,
that her symptoms betokened that she was under the depressing
influence of antimony&mdash;that conviction came upon me while in
her presence, and I could not get quit of it. I did not put a
single question to her.”</p>

<p class="p1">At half-past eleven Dr. Paterson went home, and about one
the next morning he was sent for again, but refused to go, as
he was certain he could do nothing, but sent word that he
would do so if Dr. Pritchard thought he could be of any use.
No answer came, and it was not until the Saturday morning
that he heard of Mrs. Taylor’s death, when her husband
called on him to ask him to certify the cause of death, and
the duration of her disease. This he refused, telling Mr.
Taylor that that document was not given to friends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
deceased, but only to the Registrar. Soon after Dr. Paterson
received from the Registrar the usual form to fill up, which he
returned at once in blank as it came, with this note:&mdash;“Dear
Sir,&mdash;I am surprised that I am called on to certify the cause
of death in this case. I only saw the person for a few
minutes a very short period before her death. She seemed to
be under some narcotic; but Dr. Pritchard, who was present
from the first moment of the illness until death occurred, and
which happened in his own house, may certify the cause. The
death was certainly sudden, unexpected, and to me mysterious.”
The words “the cause of death” he rendered emphatic by
underlining them. That was the only communication which he
made to anyone, beyond speaking about it in his own family.
The certificate was eventually given by Dr. Pritchard, assigning
as the cause of death “paralysis for twelve hours as the
primary cause, and the secondary, apoplexy,” the duration of
which had been one hour.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p class="p1">On the 1st of March he met Pritchard accidentally, who
asked him to come and see his wife, which he did the next day.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“She was in bed, still very weak and prostrate, and in a weak
voice expressed her satisfaction and her gratitude at my calling.
Then, in a very earnest manner, she asked me if I really thought
that her mother was dying when I saw her. I said most decidedly
I did, and had told Pritchard so. She then clasped her hands,
looked up, and feebly exclaimed, ‘Good God, is it possible!’ and
burst into a flood of tears. I put some questions then as to her
mother’s previous state of health, especially if she was habitually
addicted to the use of Battley’s solution. She told me that her
mother’s health, generally speaking, was good, but that she suffered
occasionally from what she called neuralgic headaches, and for
relief of these attacks she did take a little Battley’s solution; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
she added that she could not be said to be in the habitual use of
that medicine.</p>

<p>“I then questioned her about herself. She told me that for a
considerable time past she had suffered very much from sickness,
retching, and vomiting, with severe pains in the stomach and
throughout the bowels, accompanied with purgings, great heat and
uneasiness about the throat and mouth, and a constant urgent
thirst. I examined her tongue; it was very foul, and of a lightish
brown colour. Her features were still very sharp and deeply
flushed. Her pulse was weak, contracted, and very rapid. Her
skin was moist, but defective in animal heat, and altogether she
presented the appearance of great general prostration. Her eyes
were watery, but clear and intelligent. I prescribed for her small
quantities of brandy and champagne to recruit her strength, and
small pieces of ice to relieve the thirst and irritability of her
stomach. If she tired of these, she should have recourse to
granulated citrate of magnesia as a cooling effervescent drink, and
have a mustard poultice applied on the pit of the stomach&mdash;these
were verbal directions. I also recommended, at short intervals,
small quantities of easily digested nutritious food, such as beef tea,
calves’ foot jelly, chicken soup, arrowroot, and so on. I then wrote
a prescription for 12 grains of camomile, 24 of blue or gray
powder, 12 of powdered ipecacuanha, and 6 grains of aromatic
powder, to be carefully mixed and divided into six parts, one to be
taken daily, to relieve the biliary disturbance and soothe the
mucous lining of the alimentary canal. I gave her the prescription,
and told her to show it to Pritchard when he came home.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">From then until the day before her death the witness did
not see Mrs. Pritchard. On the 5th of March Dr. Pritchard
had called on him, and reported that his wife was better for
his advice, but still very weakly, and her stomach irritable,
and had been strongly advised by Dr. Paterson to continue the
treatment he had recommended.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Friday evening,” continued the witness, “Dr. Pritchard
called upon me personally and requested me to come and see his
wife. I did so. She was in bed in a sitting posture, supported by
pillows, and I was very much struck with her terribly altered
appearance. She seemed quite conscious. I went up to her bedside
and she caught my hand, and I could see a half-smile of
recognition on her countenance. She very soon began to mutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
something about her having been vomiting. Dr. Pritchard was
standing beside me, and he volunteered to say that she had not
been vomiting&mdash;that she was raving. She complained of great
thirst, and Pritchard poured some water out of a <i>carafe</i> into a
tumbler and gave it her, and she drank it. I observed her countenance
very much changed from what it had been when I saw her
last. Her cheeks were hollow, sharp, pinched-looking, and still
very much flushed. There was a peculiarly wild expression: the
eyes were of a fiery red and sunk-looking. Her pulse was very
weak and exceedingly rapid. Her tongue was a darkish brown
colour, very foul; and she immediately began to grasp with her
hand as if to catch some imaginary object on the bedclothes. She
muttered something about the clock, but there was none in the
room. I expressed my surprise at the great change and alarming
appearances, and asked Pritchard how long she had been confined
to bed since I saw her. He said only since morning, that yesterday
and yesterday afternoon she was in the drawing room amusing
herself with the children. I again expressed my surprise at her
alarming condition. He said she had not slept for four or five
nights, and I replied that we must endeavour to procure some
refreshing sleep. We went downstairs, and I then prescribed 30
drops of solution of morphia, 30 drops of ipecacuanha wine, 10
drops of chlorodyne, and an ounce of cinnamon water, to be taken
every four hours if the first dose did not give relief. Pritchard
wrote the prescription at my dictation. I said it was unnecessary;
it was simple, and he might mix it himself. I was anxious to save
time, and give relief as soon as possible. He said he kept no
medicines but chloroform and Battley’s solution; he did not keep
a small stock for any emergency, which I thought strange.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> I
then left the house, and at one o’clock the next morning a message
came that Mrs. Pritchard was dying, and in less than three minutes
after another that she was dead. I never entered Dr. Pritchard’s
house except on the occasions I have mentioned. I never told him
that I thought his wife had taken too much wine, and I never
recommended Dublin stout for her.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of Dr. Paterson was confined to two
points, the grounds on which he held that Mrs. Taylor had
not the appearance of having been in the habit of using
opium, and his conduct in not disclosing to some member of
her family the impression he had formed that Mrs. Pritchard
was being slowly poisoned by antimony. “When a person is
in the habit of taking opium to a great extent,” he said,
“you generally find that they are not very good in colour.
They are generally thin in features and hollow about the eyes&mdash;in
fact, not of a healthy appearance. Mrs. Taylor being
stout and healthy-looking, my impression was that she was
not an habitual consumer of opium, though she might take
it occasionally as medicine.” On the second point he stood
on professional etiquette as a consulting physician, and not
the regular medical attendant, insisting that he had no right
to revisit his patient unless sent for, and saying that he
believed he should never have been called in the second time
had he not accidentally met Dr. Pritchard in the street.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“His first impression arose simply from seeing Mrs. Pritchard
at the time of her mother’s fatal seizure, when he formed his
diagnosis from the symptoms that were present, just as he was in
the habit of forming his opinion of any patient he saw for the first
time&mdash;judging from symptomatology, the science of the signs of
disease. It was not his duty to interfere in the family without
being invited, as there was another doctor in the house, and he
did the best he could by apprising the registrar when refusing to
sign the certificate of Mrs. Taylor’s death. Had he been called
in consultation with another medical man, he should have felt it
his duty to state his medical opinion; and had there been a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination of Mrs. Taylor’s body at the time, he believed
that in all probability the drugging of Mrs. Pritchard with antimony
would have gone no further, at least at that time.”</p>

<p class="p1">When called in the second time on the 2nd of March, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I believed her to be suffering under poisoning by antimony,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and I prescribed accordingly. I saw her alone, but I did not
give her any indication of what I thought her ailment. I did not
mention antimony or poison in the slightest. I did not give her
any idea that she was labouring under any but a natural disease,
because the treatment which I prescribed for her, provided she
got nothing else, was in my mind quite sufficient to have very
soon brought her round, taking it for granted that my advice was
carefully walked up to. I did not mention to Dr. Pritchard that
his wife was being poisoned by antimony. It would not have
been a very safe matter to have done so. I did not go back the
next day to see if my advice had been acted on. I did not consider
that she was my patient at all. I had no right or title to
go back and see her. In any case where a consultation is held,
the consulting physician has no right to go back to see the
patient; it would be a breach of the etiquette of the profession.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i> Dr. Paterson stoutly adhered to his
opinion that his being called in to see Mrs. Pritchard was
purely accidental, and that it would not have been very natural
to have communicated his suspicions to the husband.</p>

<p class="psh">PURCHASE AND POSSESSION OF MEDICINES AND POISONS
BY THE PRISONER.</p>

<p>The prisoner, when it was suggested by Dr. Paterson that
he should mix in his own consulting-room the prescription,
on the 17th of March, told the doctor that he did not, like
other medical men, keep in his house a small stock of medicines
for any emergency. It was, however, proved that in the
presses in his room were at least five-and-thirty bottles of
medicinal preparations, and several papers and bottles of
poisons; and that he had been a constant purchaser of
poisons, and especially of Fleming’s tincture of aconite and
tartarised antimony, from September, 1864, to as late as the
16th of March, 1865.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> According to the witnesses for the
prosecution, the quantities of antimony and tincture of
aconite bought by him were largely in excess of the amounts
sold to other medical men, though not so according to the
experience of two druggists called by the prisoner. Anyhow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
as will be seen by the list in the note, the purchases
were larger than could have been required in any ordinary
practice. Besides the phials and papers subsequently proved to
contain poison, in one of the presses was a bottle labelled
Battley’s solution, which was found to contain an appreciable
quantity of antimony, to the extent of 1·5 of a grain per fluid
ounce, and the remainder of the tapioca to be charged with
4·62 grains of antimony to the pound. A phial containing
3·5 grains of tartarised antimony, and three others containing
tincture of conium, and six other phials with small portions of
tincture of aconite, conium, and digitalis, were found in the
prisoner’s cupboard. In the chloroform, no metallic poison
was discovered; but in a small wooden box with a screw cover
were 15·5 grains of tartarised antimony and arsenious acid
(the common poison of arsenic), in nearly equal proportions;
35 grains of tartarised antimony in a pasteboard box, and
about ten drops of aqueous solution of corrosive sublimate
were found in a quart wine-bottle.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>


<p class="psh">MEDICAL AND CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF THE BODIES OF
MRS. TAYLOR AND MRS. PRITCHARD.</p>

<p class="pc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Taylor.</span></p>

<p class="p1">On the 29th and 30th of March the exhumed body of Mrs.
Taylor was medically and chemically examined by <i>Dr. Maclagan</i>,
the professor of medical jurisprudence in the university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
of Edinburgh, and <i>Dr. Henry Duncan Littlejohn</i>, surgeon of
the Edinburgh police. In accordance with the admirable
practice of the Scotch courts these experts gave in formal
certificates “on soul and conscience,” which were read in
court before any personal examination was allowed. The
medical report, after detailing the healthy condition in which
the different portions of the body were found, concluded by
stating that the examiners “had not been able to discover in
the body any morbid appearances capable of accounting for
death, and that they were of opinion that the cause of death
could not be determined without chemical analysis, and that
for that purpose they had secured the alimentary canal and its
contents, the heart and some of the blood, the liver, the kidneys,
the bladder and uterus, and a portion of the brain,”
which had been entrusted to Dr. Maclagan, of whose report
the substance is now given:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<i>Contents of stomach</i>, amounting to five ounces, having been first
tested for vegetable poisons, and then for meconic acid, without
success, ‘the residues of the above process were tested for mineral
poisons; and a preliminary trial, by Reinsch’s method, having
revealed the presence of antimony, I subjected the whole to a
process by which I was enabled to determine the amount of this
metal (process then described). Assuming, for reasons afterwards
to be given, that the antimony existed in the form of tartar
emetic, the amount of this represented by the sulphuret which
I obtained from the stomach was a little more than a quarter of a
grain (0·279).</p>

<p>“<i>Contents of intestines.</i>&mdash;The whole contents were evaporated at
a gentle heat on the water-bath, and a dry residue obtained,
weighing 430 grains. Ten grains of this, by Reinsch’s process,
yielded a characteristic deposit of antimony. To determine in
what form this antimony existed, other ten grains were treated
with distilled water, the solution filtered, and the fluid subjected
to Reinsch’s process. A characteristic antimonial deposit was
obtained, thus proving that this metal was present in a soluble
form. There are only two soluble forms of antimony met with
in commerce. One of these, the chloride, is a dark-coloured, acid,
corrosive fluid, totally unsuited for internal administration. The
other is what is known scientifically as ‘tartarised antimony,’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
popularly as ‘tartar emetic,’ a colourless substance possessed of
comparatively little taste, and in daily use as a medicinal agent.
I have no doubt it was in this form that the antimony had been
taken, which I found in the alimentary canal of Mrs. Taylor.
I endeavoured to determine the amount of antimony in the contents
of the intestines, but the deposit was too small to enable
me with confidence to make it the subject of a quantitative
determination. No arsenic was found.</p>

<p>“<i>The Blood.</i>&mdash;From one ounce a characteristic antimonial deposit
was obtained.</p>

<p>“<i>The Liver.</i>&mdash;By operating on 1000 grains of this, I obtained a
quantity of sulphuret, indicating that the whole liver contained
one grain and one-tenth (1·151) of tartar emetic. I also examined
the other solid organs and tissues removed from Mrs. Taylor’s
body, in each case following Reinsch’s method, and in each case
obtaining on copper a characteristic antimonial deposit. I thus
found that there was more or less of antimony present in the
muscular substance of the heart, the spleen, the kidney, the
coats of the stomach, and of the rectum, the uterus, and the
brain.</p>

<p>“<i>Lastly.</i> As Mrs. Taylor’s body had been exhumed, I thought
it my duty to examine some of the earth in which it had been
interred, though this was superfluous, from the fact of the soil
being dry, and the coffin entire: it was not found to contain
a trace of soluble antimony, and was therefore incapable of
impregnating with this metal any body buried in it.”</p></div>

<p class="psh"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pritchard.</span></p>

<p>On the 21st of March a similar examination was made of
the body of Mrs. Pritchard three days after death by the same
medical men, who reported “that it presented no appearances
of recent morbid action beyond a certain irritation of the
alimentary canal, and nothing at all capable of accounting for
death.” They had therefore secured for chemical analysis
those parts of the body which they deemed likely to disclose
the cause of death. As a portion of this analysis had been
conducted during the temporary absence of Dr. Maclagan in
London by Dr. Gamgee and Dr. Littlejohn, previously to the
report being read they were called to prove that Dr. Maclagan’s
report of what they had done in his absence was correct. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
following was the substance of the report of the chemical
analysis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“(1.) <i>Contents of stomach</i> amounted to little more than ½ an
ounce, and free from all odour of any poisonous drug. Not a trace
of any vegetable poison or of antimony was found.</p>

<p>“(2.) <i>Urine.</i>&mdash;The presence of antimony having already been
ascertained in a portion of this secretion, the remainder (7 ounces) was
employed to determine the quantity. The process followed was
that by which antimony is obtained in the form of the sulphuret,
after destroying the organic matter by means of hydrochloric acid
and potash. The quantity was readily weighed, and found to be
rather more than one-tenth of a grain (0·1078). This corresponds
to nearly one-fourth of a grain (0·121) of tartar emetic.</p>

<p>“(3.) <i>The Bile.</i>&mdash;A little more than ½ an ounce of this fluid was
obtained from the gall-bladder. By Reinsch’s process 50 minims
readily gave an antimonial deposit. The remainder (4 drachms)
used to determine the amount, yielded sulphuret of antimony corresponding
to more than one-tenth of a grain (0·121) of tartar emetic.</p>

<p>“(4.) <i>The Blood.</i>&mdash;1 ounce, by Reinsch’s process, readily gave
evidence of the presence of antimony.</p>

<p>“(5.) <i>The Liver.</i>&mdash;The weight was 36 ounces, a portion of which,
weighing less than 4 ounces (1460 grains), by Reinsch’s process,
gave sufficient antimony to coat rather more than four square
inches of copper foil. (This experiment was satisfactorily tested by
another process described in the report.) As to quantity, 1,000
grains gave of sulphuret of antimony 0·1234 grains, corresponding
to a quarter of a grain of tartar emetic, making the whole amount
contained in the liver almost exactly 4 grains (3·93 grains).</p>

<p>“I next examined the remainder of the solid organs removed
from the body of Mrs. Pritchard, and found more or less antimony
in the whole of them.</p>

<p>“I also examined certain articles of clothing and bed-linen
handed to me by the officer, and in the stains on four of them&mdash;the
chemise, two sheets, and a toilet-cover, on which was a stain
as of wine&mdash;I found antimony. From these experiments I have
been led to the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>“(1.) Mrs. Pritchard had taken a large quantity of antimony in
the form of tartar emetic.</p>

<p>“(2.) Having regard to the absence in her body of any morbid
appearances sufficient to account for death, and to the presence in
it of a substance known as capable of destroying life, her death
must be ascribed to the action of antimony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>“(3.) That it is most unlikely that this poison was taken in a
single large dose. Had this been the case, I should have expected
to have found some more decided evidence of irritant action in the
mouth, the throat, or the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>“(4.) That from the extent to which the whole organs and fluids
of the body were impregnated with it, it must have been taken in
repeated doses, the aggregate of which must have amounted to a
large quantity.</p>

<p>“(5.) That from the large amount found in the liver, from its
ready detection in the blood, and from its being found passing so
copiously out of the body by the bile and the urine, it is probable
that some of the poison had been taken at no greater interval than
a period of a few days previous to death.</p>

<p>“(6.) That I am inclined to believe that it had not been
administered, at all events in any great quantity, within a few
hours of her death. Had this been the case, I should have
expected to have found at least some traces of it in the contents
of the stomach, and more in those of the intestines; whereas none
was found in the former, and the amount found in the latter seems
to be amply accounted for by the bile impregnated with the poison
discharged into them from the liver.</p>

<p>“(7.) That the period over which the administration had extended
cannot be determined by mere chemical investigation, but
must be deduced from the history of the case, with which I am
unacquainted.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Maclagan</i> then stated what portions of the bodies he
had handed to Professor Penny for further analysis, and
described the result of his examination of the solid residue
obtained from Mrs. Pritchard’s body by the process adopted
by Dr. Gamgee and Dr. Littlejohn.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I determined the presence of mercury, and found a considerable
quantity of antimony remaining in it. I got a clear fluid by
operating on that residue with chlorate of potash and hydrochloric
acid; and then passing sulphuretted hydrogen, I got a precipitate
of a dirty orange colour, which was collected, washed and boiled in
strong hydrochloric acid. The yellow colour disappeared, and the
precipitate became black. The hydrochloric solution was then
mixed with water and tartaric acid, and it gave an orange precipitate
which, when collected and weighed, amounted to 0.082, equal
on the whole to 1.265 of sulphuret of antimony&mdash;rather more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
a grain and a quarter&mdash;in the whole of the solid residue. This was
in addition to what had been found in the intestines after the
precipitate had been obtained by Dr. Gamgee and Dr. Littlejohn.
A grain and a quarter of sulphuret of antimony is equal to two
and a half of tartar emetic; the amount of tartar emetic in the
whole of the intestines would be about five grains and three-quarters
(5.712).”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>In cross-examination, Dr. Maclagan</i> deposed to the discovery
of about the three hundredth part of a grain of mercury
in the 50 grains of sulphuret; that in some cases he was not
content with the mere presence of the deposit on the foil, but
boiled the copper foil in potash&mdash;namely, with the contents of
the intestines and with the liver&mdash;but otherwise was content
with the coloured deposit.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Frederick Penny</i> then gave in his reports on the portions
of the bodies of Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Pritchard, given to him
by Dr. Maclagan. The following is the substance of the report
in Mrs. Pritchard’s case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<i>Dried Contents of Intestines.</i>&mdash;By the first process employed an
abundant black precipitate was obtained, which by proper treatment
was separated into sulphide of antimony and sulphide of
mercury. The sulphide of antimony, which was obtained of a fine
orange-red colour, was washed, dried, and weighed. Its weight
corresponded to a quantity of metallic arsenic equal to 2.1 grains
in one thousand parts of the dried contents of the stomach. The
same sulphide was found to be readily soluble in sulphide of
ammonium, and also in hydrochloric acid; and the acid solution,
when poured into water, gave a white precipitate, and when boiled
with copper ribbon deposited a violet-coloured coating on the surface
of the copper. The coated copper, on being heated in a glass
tube, gave no distinct crystalline sublimate. All these results
are eminently characteristic of sulphide of antimony when thus
treated.</p>

<p>“The sulphide of mercury gave metallic mercury corresponding
to 3 grains in 1,000 grains of the dried contents of the intestines.
The report then states how these tests were confirmed by further
experiments on the solution by Reinsch’s test supplemented by
that of Marsh.</p>

<p>“<i>Stomach</i>, by the same methods, yielded antimony in appreciable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
proportions, equal to 0.5 of a grain in 1,000 parts, but no
mercury; that it was afterwards treated for morphia and aconite,
but not a trace of these substances was obtained.</p>

<p>“<i>Liver</i> found to contain antimony equal to one-tenth of a grain
in 1,000 parts, but no mercury.</p>

<p>“<i>Spleen</i> yielded antimony in about the same proportion as the
liver, and also contained mercury in well-marked quantity.</p>

<p>“<i>Kidney</i> about the same proportion as the liver, and a minute
trace of mercury.</p>

<p>“<i>Heart</i> yielded antimony in a proportion rather larger than that
found in the liver, and less mercury than in the spleen.</p>

<p>“<i>Brain</i> yielded antimony in less quantity than the liver, and no
mercury.</p>

<p>“<i>Blood</i> yielded a small quantity of antimony, and a faint trace
of mercury.</p>

<p>“<i>Rectum</i>, antimony in less quantity than the liver, and no indications
of mercury.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In the case of Mrs. Taylor, <i>Dr. Penny</i> reported:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That all the articles submitted to him (liver, stomach, heart,
kidney, rectum, blood, and dried contents of intestines), and subjected
to analysis, contained antimony; (2), that the contents of
the intestines contained the largest proportion of antimony (0.583
parts in 1,000 parts); next, the liver and stomach (0.047 of a
grain in 1,000 grains in each); then the blood, and, in less quantity,
the heart, kidney, and rectum; (3), that part of the antimony
in the contents of the intestines was in a form soluble in water;
(4), that the kidney was the only article in which mercury was
detected; (5), that neither the stomach, nor the contents of the
intestines, contained aconite or morphia in quantity sufficient to be
detected by known chemical processes; (6), that the articles subjected
to analysis contained no other metallic poison than antimony
and mercury as reported above.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Penny</i> also handed in his reports of the examination
of the contents of the cupboards in Dr. Pritchard’s consulting
room, the substance of which has already been given. In the
first of these reports, that of the 17th of May, Dr. Penny had
stated that he was at present engaged in testing the bottle of
Battley’s solution (in which he had discovered antimony) for
other substances, the result of which inquiry he now detailed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I looked for mercury and other metals. I searched for aconite,
and also for conium. I found aconite. This is tested chiefly by
the taste of the abstract obtained by evaporation, and by its physiological
action upon small animals. A portion of the fluid was
evaporated to dryness, and the extract thus obtained was very
carefully tasted, or its effects upon the tongue and on the lips
ascertained by applying them to it. The effects were a tingling
and benumbing sensation&mdash;characteristic of aconite. To another
portion of the extract, dissolved in water, ammonia was added, and
a precipitate was separated and examined in the same way, after
being dissolved in diluted hydrochloric acid. The benumbing and
tingling sensation produced by that precipitate was very slight.
But the ammoniacal liquid, after the separation of the precipitate,
was treated with hydrochloric acid, and evaporated, and the sensation
produced by this residue was very strong.</p>

<p>“With a view to ascertain the character of aconite when mixed
with Battley’s solution, I mixed known quantities of tincture of
aconite with Battley’s solution, treating the mixtures in the same
way. I took Fleming’s tincture and the results were precisely
similar; but when the proportion of aconite was equal to 5 per
cent., the sensation was by no means strong; but when it was in
the proportion of 10 per cent., it gave a sensation, though the
same, much stronger than that of the liquid in the bottle. I
draw the conclusion, therefore, that in this solution the proportion
was between 5 and 10 per cent. I purchased genuine Battley’s
solution at several establishments in Glasgow, including that of
‘Murdoch Brothers,’ and was satisfied that none of them contained
either antimony or aconite.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Penny</i> then detailed his experiments with pure and
impure Battley’s solution on rabbits. Genuine Battley, when
injected under the skin, did not kill; 40 grain drops from the
bottle found in Mrs. Taylor’s dress did.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I made in all about ten experiments with the genuine Battley’s
mixed with Fleming’s aconite. I will tell you the result of two
experiments. In one set I injected a mixture of Battley into three
young rabbits, and in a third into full grown rabbits. In the first
set with young rabbits I injected 10 grains of genuine Battley’s
solution. In the second experiment with a young rabbit I injected
10 grains of this Battley’s (that found in the prisoner’s cupboard);
in the third, I injected a mixture of 9 grains of genuine Battley,
and 1 grain of Fleming’s tincture of aconite. In the cases of the
old rabbits I proceeded in a similar way, only increasing the dose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
to 40 grains. The symptoms manifested by the rabbits, old and
young, subjected to the action of genuine Battley, were simple in
character and few in number, and were not materially altered by
the variation of the dose. The animal soon assumed a prone position,
resting on the belly and chest, and the head invariably resting
on the ground. The forelegs were either sprawling or gathered
under the body, the hind legs always extended sideways; the eyes
remained open, and the pupils were natural and not contracted;
the breathing was invariably gentle; no cries were uttered, and
no convulsions or spasms of the body were apparent. There was
a complete condition of inanity, and, with the exception of the
open state of the eyes, the animal seemed to be in a state of profound
sleep. There was no indication of spasmodic movement,
and, when aroused and urged to motion, the movements were
always performed in a crawling, tortoise-like manner. In this
state the animal remained for several hours, and then gradually
recovered.</p>

<p>“The effects produced by the mixture of genuine Battley with
aconite presented a striking contrast to those resulting from pure
Battley. Very soon after the injection the animal became restless
and uneasy, and then began to crouch, resting on its flank, with
the hind legs extending laterally, and the head erect. It next
assumed a sitting posture, in an attitude of watchful expectancy,
and commenced to twitch its lips and move its jaws as if chewing.
Suddenly it staggers, rolls over, and quickly regains its feet.
Saliva begins to flow from the mouth, and soon after piteous and
peculiar choking cries are emitted. Its head is retracted, and the
breathing is painfully laborious. Convulsions now set in, followed
by intervals in which the limbs are quite relaxed, and the animal
lies helpless on its side. Frantic leaps are now frequently taken,
accompanied by movements of a paralytic character. A state of
utter prostration also occurs, variable in duration, and then a
strong convulsion comes on, during which, or immediately after
which, the animal expires, the limbs becoming instantly relaxed.</p>

<p>“<i>The symptoms exhibited by the rabbits subjected to the Battley
from the prisoner’s cupboard responded in every important respect
with the effects produced by this mixture, and it was impossible to
detect any essential difference in them.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The Battley’s solution used by Dr. Penny was not purchased
from “Murdoch Brothers,” but he had purchased and
analysed some from that house, and it was exactly similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
that which he had used. He had also been present when the
same experiments as his were tried on rabbits by Dr. Maclagan,
in the presence of Drs. Christison, Gamgee, and
Littlejohn, with the same result as in his experiments. Dr.
Penny was then examined on Dr. Maclagan’s report of his
<i>post-mortem</i> examination of Mrs. Pritchard’s body, and on the
symptoms exhibited by her from the time she was taken ill in
1865 down to her death. Replying purely as a chemist, and
not as a medical man, he declared them to correspond with the
action of tartar emetic or tartarised antimony. He further
accounted for the presence of the small portions of mercury
by the administration of Dr. Paterson’s powders, <i>Hydrargyrum
cum creta</i>, shortly before death. In Mrs. Taylor’s case he
considered the vomitings to be the result of the antimony,
which had been traced by the analyses, and repeated the conclusions,
already given, to his reports on both bodies.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Maclagan</i>, who was recalled, declared that the whole
of the symptoms in Mrs. Pritchard’s case, from Christmas,
1864, until her death&mdash;the sickness and vomiting, muscular
depression, irritation of the bowels, and cramp in the stomach&mdash;were
symptoms of poisoning by antimony, and could not, as
a medical man, suggest any natural disease to which they were
due, that he could assign as the cause of death. He had
never seen antimony when rubbed into the skin (referring to
the prisoner’s statement that he had done so for a swollen
gland in his wife’s neck) produce any constitutional effect.
The fact of Mrs. Pritchard some years ago having taken antimony
internally for inflammation of the eyelids would not
account for the symptoms; and he agreed with Dr. Penny
that the traces of mercury were due to the powders prescribed
by Dr. Paterson. “There was nothing in the case,” he
added, “to indicate to a medical man of ordinary intelligence
that she was suffering from gastric fever, or any other fever”;
and he adhered to the conclusions already given in his report,
that she had been poisoned by minute doses of antimony in
the form of tartar emetic given at intervals over a long period
of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Maclagan attributed Mrs. Taylor’s death to something
more than antimony&mdash;some powerful, depressing poison.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The symptoms,” he said, “might be produced by aconite&mdash;being
found with her head fallen on her neck, and hardly observed
to breathe, her pulse almost if not absolutely imperceptible, and
the dozing, torpid state in which she lay, were such as would
result from aconite. Though he might know in a case that aconite
had been taken, he might not be able to find it by chemical
analysis: these organic poisons&mdash;all the alkaloids&mdash;are very often
not found, though known to have been taken. The administration
of opium might diminish the effect of antimony in causing
vomiting and purging, but its depressing effect on the muscular
system would still remain; and if opium, aconite, and antimony
were being administered at the same time, he should anticipate
symptoms such as appeared in Mrs. Taylor’s case. Taking the
symptoms and the results of the <i>post-mortem</i> examination together,
the idea of apoplexy was satisfactorily excluded from his judgment;
and assuming the correctness of Dr. Paterson’s description of the
symptoms he saw, he should not have concluded that it was apoplexy,
nor did he think any other medical man would have. He
was satisfied with the presence of aconite in the Battley’s solution,
without the experiments on the rabbits, which only confirmed it.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness was directed to the
question whether the symptoms in Mrs. Taylor’s case did not
indicate poisoning by opium, probably arising from an overdose
of Battley’s solution.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I saw,” said the witness, “no precise indications of poisoning
by opium, though I cannot say that she had not taken some. I
think aconite was the leading feature in the final part of the case.
The symptoms described by Dr. Paterson did not, in my mind,
indicate poisoning by opium or laudanum at all. They were not
inconsistent with her having taken opium, but they were not consistent
with her having been poisoned by it, and with the ordinary
symptoms. The symptoms of aconite predominated. If she had
taken opium alone I should have expected to find the pulse full
and slow, and probably the breathing laborious and stertorous.
Though these were absent, I could not say that she had not taken
opium, particularly if she had been accustomed to its use.” <i>When
reminded from the judge’s notes that Dr. Paterson had described the
breathing as “laborious,” he said</i>, “It does not make much, indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
not any, modification of my view, because the condition of the pulse
showed the action of aconite on the heart. Laborious breathing is
an indication of many things besides opium.” <i>When reminded that
Dr. Paterson spoke of her being in a state of “coma</i>,” he admitted
that that generally indicated opium and not aconite, but added
that here “it was more oppression than true coma,” and assumed
that Dr. Paterson did not use the word scientifically, but as many
persons did to describe insensibility. “<i>But,” said Mr. Clark, “you
pointed to the absence of ‘coma’ as indicative of poisoning by aconite.</i>”
“I spoke of her,” replied Dr. Maclagan, “being in a torpid condition,
which I think was connected with the weakened state of the
circulation and not from fulness of the brain. Opium, like
aconite, is a vegetable poison, and is absorbed into the system: a
person may be poisoned by it without any trace remaining in the
stomach or the system capable of being detected by chemical
analysis. All mineral poisons are more easily detected, but I am
not prepared to give into the statement broadly that a person
cannot be poisoned by antimony without it being capable of detection,
though I cannot recollect such a case. The quantity here
found in both cases was considerable. The expectation is that the
chemical analysis will detect it, but there may be exceptions. The
fact that Mrs. Taylor’s eyes were contracted is an indication of
poisoning by opium, but it also occurs in aconite, though the cases
vary a good deal in that respect, from people, as I think, having
observed the symptoms at different stages; and the probability is
that contraction had been produced at first, and then relaxation at
the time all the muscular parts became relaxed&mdash;namely, at the
time of death. Aconite is applied externally in neuralgia.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Littlejohn</i>, who was next called, concurred in the
opinion that there was nothing to indicate gastric fever in
Mrs. Pritchard’s case, and that her death was due to the continuous
administration of small doses of antimony from the
commencement of her illness to the day of her death, and
that the result of the chemical analysis was such as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
should, on that supposition, have expected. On the cause of
Mrs. Taylor’s death he was not so certain.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It seemed to me,” said the witness, “that she might have died
from a dose of antimony administered shortly before death, or else
from some sedative narcotic poison. I have no difficulty in saying
that she died of poison, but only as to the particular poison which
killed her. I am inclined to believe that the symptoms in her
case were mixed to some extent, like the symptoms of narcotic
poison, and to some extent like the symptoms of antimony.
There was nothing to show that she died of apoplexy, and the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination did not indicate any such. In the failure of
circulation and great depression and spasms, and the state of
insensibility, I recognise the action of antimony; in the later
stages of antimonial poisoning we have generally great insensibility.
The hot taste in the mouth and burning sensation in the
throat after taking the bit of cheese suggest a large dose of antimony,
and also suggest a strong dose of narcotic poison&mdash;they suggest
many things besides cheese. That it caused violent sickness
in the case of one of the servants for some hours is quite consistent
with antimonial poisoning. In large quantities it would produce a
burning sensation in the throat. I have tried it in large quantities,
and the secondary sensation is always in the throat, and it did
produce a burning sensation. That the egg flip gave the same
effect in the case of the servant points to the use of antimony or
some substance resembling it. Various other emetics might produce
these effects. Egg flip is a convenient medium for administering
antimony, as it readily dissolves in it, and sufficient antimony
could be dusted on loaf sugar to produce sickness. Sugar is very
porous, and antimony, being a white powder, could be dusted over
it, and a large quantity absorbed in it&mdash;sufficient, not to kill, but to
keep up the illness.”</p>

<p class="p1">In cross-examination, the witness adhered to his opinion as
to the suitableness of egg flip when the hot water had been
poured on it, as a medium for antimony, and to the possibility
of a sufficient quantity to produce sickness being conveyed
into the cup on two pieces of loaf sugar. Though he
had not made any special experiments to support this opinion,
he considered himself, from his special acquaintance with
tartar emetic, entitled to answer in the way he had done. He
did not consider opium as a sedative but as a narcotic, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
his opinion, aconite was a sedative narcotic. There was
nothing impossible for Mrs. Taylor to take opium, and for
that to contribute to the symptoms.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Paterson</i>, who was re-called, was quite confirmed
in his previous opinion of the cause of Mrs. Pritchard’s
death from the evidence he had heard. Mrs. Taylor’s
death, he thought, had been caused by opium, but there
might have been some other narcotic combined to him
unknown, and he thought that aconite and opium combined
would contribute to the effect and hurry the termination;
but he never in his practice had seen any person
poisoned by such a combination. He had not the slightest
suspicion of antimony, and the narcotic effect was such when
he saw Mrs. Taylor that he did not believe that he could
recognise the effect of antimony. The narcotic effect would
overpower the other, and laudanum would interfere with the
usual effect of antimony. What he called stertorous breathing
was rather oppressed breathing&mdash;snoring and stertorous
breathing were the same thing. “By coma,” he added, “I
meant insensibility&mdash;it means that, especially insensibility
under opium; and my impression was that it was opium
alone, or some of its preparations: it might be morphia.”
Now that he had heard of the discovery of antimony in the
body, he believed the death to be due to a combination of antimony
and opium, a smaller dose of the latter being likely to
have a greater effect, in consequence of the condition of the
body produced by the former. If the opium contained upwards
of five per cent. of aconite, the effect, he considered,
would be much more rapid and more likely to be fatal.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the medical testimony witnesses were
called to prove that at two banks in Glasgow, where Dr.
Pritchard had accounts, these were overdrawn on the 20th of
March&mdash;that he borrowed to the extent of £255 on his life
policy, the last advance being as late as the 13th of May&mdash;that
his mother-in-law had advanced him £500 towards the
purchase of his house, and that under her will he would be
entitled, in the event of the previous death of his wife, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
interest on two-thirds of her property for the benefit of his
children until they attained twenty-one years, and then “for
his own use as he might consider proper.” Letters of Mrs.
Taylor and Dr. Pritchard were identified, in one of the latter
being an entry under February 7th, “Dr. J. M. C. here; on
February 8th Dr. J. M. C. left”&mdash;namely, Dr. Cowan.</p>

<p class="psh">THE PRISONER’S STATEMENTS.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Scotch practice, two declarations
were made by Dr. Pritchard before the sheriff, one on the
22nd of March, and the other on the 21st of April. The <i>first
declaration</i> was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have always attended my wife in all her ailments of every
kind during the whole period of our married lives, now fifteen
years, and some of these illnesses were very severe; but I never
saw her so ill as she was on the occasion which terminated fatally.
As far as my judgment goes, her last illness was gastric fever,
which commenced about the beginning of the present year. I
gave my wife no medicines during her illness excepting wine,
champagne, and brandy, to support her strength; and I gave her
no medicines at all. I trusted to nature to right itself, with the
assistance of these restoratives. During the last six weeks her
power of sleeping entirely went away. In order to procure sleep I
gave her, at the commencement of her sleeplessness, a small quantity
of chloroform, but it entirely disagreed with her, and I discontinued
it. I then called in Dr. Gairdner, professor of medicine
in the university, and he visited and saw her several times; and he
continued to attend her till her old medical friend, Dr. James M.
Cowan, returned, and he came from Edinburgh to see her.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> I then
wrote to her mother to come and nurse her, and she arrived about
the 11th of February last; and her arrival had a beneficial effect upon
Mrs. Pritchard for some time, but still the sleeplessness continued;
and shortly after her mother’s death, which happened on the 25th
of February, she relapsed and became much worse, and very apprehensive
about herself, and she suggested to me the adoption of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
medicine with which her mother was very familiar&mdash;Battley’s solution
of opium&mdash;but I declined to give her any without first consulting
Dr. J. Paterson, who lived close by. I saw him, and consulted
him, but he did not see Mrs. Pritchard on that occasion, and he
did not approve of using the solution of opium. He prescribed
granulated citrate of magnesia, calomel, mercury, and chalk, and I
acted on his advice and administered the medicine, and it seemed
to have a beneficial effect.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Some time after, finding her sleeplessness
still continued, I, at her own suggestion, applied a solution of
atropine to the external parts of the eye, and it had a little effect
for some time, but the effects soon ceased. After her mother’s
death, she became rapidly worse; indeed, I ascribed her decease
to the agitation consequent on her mother’s death. At the time
of the last event she was strongly impressed with the idea that she
would herself die at the same time as her mother; in fact, she did
die on a subsequent day at exactly the same hour. On the night
preceding her death she was apprehensive that, unless she got
sleep, she should not get through the night. I went for Dr. Paterson,
who came immediately and sat for a considerable time by the
bedside, and afterwards dictated a prescription, which was made up
at the Glasgow Apothecary Company’s shop at Elmbank-street. It
will be found in my desk at home. It was for two draughts to be
given four hours after the first if it did not succeed. She got the
first draught as prescribed by Dr. Paterson about ten o’clock, but
she said after drinking it that it was not half strong enough, and
asked if she might have some of her mother’s medicine. I refused
to give it her, and said I dare not do it. I gave her a glass of
port wine, and sat carefully watching for a short time. I then
went down stairs and had supper, and, after being absent for some
time, returned to see if she had got to sleep. I found her awake,
and she wished me to give her something to make her sleep. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
refused, and she then asked me to come to bed, as I must be tired
with the weary nights of watching. It was then about twelve
o’clock. I tried to persuade her that I should sit up to watch her
till past the time when her mother had died; but to please her I
got into bed, and almost immediately I fell asleep from the state
of exhaustion I was in; was awoke by her pulling at my beard,
and found my wife struggling to get into bed. She appeared to
have got out of bed. She said, ‘Edward, I am faint.’ I assisted
her into bed, and asked her how long I had been asleep, but she
answered, ‘Don’t speak; look! do you see my mother?’ I said
‘No, it is only a vision; only imagination,’ and asked if she felt
pain. She said she felt cold, and I need try no more skill; that I
had failed this time, and that she was going to her mother. I got
alarmed and rang the bell violently, and the youngest servant
came. I desired her to make a mustard plaster as quickly as she
could, and on that my wife turned round and said, ‘Edward, I’m
in my senses; mustard plasters will do no good,’ and almost immediately
she fell back in my arms and died. The servant came
with the mustard plaster, and found her in that position. I did
not give her any other medicine at that time except a little brandy
applied to her lips.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> During the whole course of her illness I
never gave her any antimony, nor any medicine in which there
was any preparation of antimony. Antimony is a poison, but it is
used occasionally to subdue inflammations, and I applied it to her
neck, in October last, when she was plagued with a swelling gland
in the neck. I rubbed it in externally on that occasion, and I
have never given her any antimony since. On that occasion I
recommended change of air, and I gave her a little bottle of antimony
with her for the same purpose of rubbing in behind the ear.
She went to Edinburgh at that time, and she returned to Glasgow
very much better, and I have never seen the bottle of antimony
since she got it away with her. There was a considerable quantity
of antimony in my repositories at the time of my wife’s last illness,
as I used it extensively in my practice, and it was kept in a cupboard
of which I had the key, but which was not always locked. I
did not see any of it brought out, or lying about, during her illness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
The cupboard where the antimony was is in the consulting-room
on the ground flat, and she was so weak on the day of her
death&mdash;Saturday&mdash;and on the Friday preceding, that I do not
think she had strength to have gone to the cupboard herself. My
wife took the antimony internally on one occasion when she had a
tendency to inflammation of the eyelids. This was years ago, and
I never knew her to use it internally, except on this occasion. I
never administered antimony to her internally on any occasion, nor
any other substance calculated to injure or destroy life.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the <i>second declaration</i>, made on the 21st day of April,
1865, he confirmed the correctness of the former one when
read to him, denied the charges as laid in the indictment,
and elected to make the following voluntary statement with
reference to Mrs. Taylor’s death:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I never administered poison to her. I did, and I do believe,
that she died from paralysis and apoplexy. I have no further
statements to make, and by the advice of my agent will make
none, with the exception that I am entirely innocent of the charge
preferred against me.”</p>

<p class="p1">Being asked by the Procurator Fiscal whether he ever
administered or caused to be administered to the said Jane
Cowan or Taylor tartarised antimony, declares:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My agent recommended me to say nothing, and I decline to
answer the question, and, as I act under my agent’s advice, it is
unnecessary to put any further questions.”</p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>With this evidence the prosecution was closed late on the
third day, and on the next the defence was opened by calling
witnesses on the Prisoner’s behalf.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Michael Taylor</i>, Mrs. Pritchard’s brother, had seen
her on the 28th of February, a few days after his mother’s
death, when she objected to Dr. Gairdner again visiting her,
and to following her brother’s advice to have a nurse, as she
did not like strangers about her. He also identified as her
writing two letters from Edinburgh to her husband at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
time of her visit to her parents in November, in which she
spoke of the slowness of her recovery and her inability to go
out, except two or three times.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Simpson</i>, a partner in Duncan &amp; Co., Chemists, in
Edinburgh, remembered Dr. Pritchard, some four years ago,
purchasing Battley’s solution at their shop, and that shortly
afterwards other purchases of this compound were frequently
made in his name by one Thomson, whom he recognised,
down to the beginning of 1865. <i>Fairgrieve</i>, another chemist
in Edinburgh, spoke to repeated purchases of this compound
by or for Mrs. Taylor for several years before her death, once
in a 5-oz. bottle, but generally in bottles of 2 oz.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Two other witnesses proved that they consulted Dr.
Pritchard for affections of the ear, and that to the first he
gave a bottle labelled “poison&mdash;2 drops in each ear every
night,” and to the other a tonic of glycerine and strychnia;
the object being to account for the numerous poisons found in
the cupboard in his consulting room.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> <i>Dr. McHattie</i> proved
that there were not the necessary drugs in the cupboard to
enable the Prisoner to make up Dr. Paterson’s prescription,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
and afterwards his eldest son certified that his father and
mother lived happily together, and his daughter, who lived
chiefly with her grandparents, that they were fond of each
other. The evidence for the defence then was closed.</p>

<p class="psh">THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH.</p>

<p>In addressing the jury on the evidence, the counsel for the
prosecution drew their especial attention to (1) the fact&mdash;not
contested and not contestable&mdash;that though none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
medicines prescribed by the medical attendants on both of
the ladies had contained any preparation of antimony, antimony
was found in their bodies&mdash;in that of Mrs. Pritchard in
such proportions as could only be accounted for by a long
continuous administration of that drug&mdash;in Mrs. Taylor’s
sufficient to so reduce her system as to increase the operation
of any narcotic poison; (2) that the notion of this having
been taken by accident was excluded even by the prisoner’s
own statement, and that the idea of suicide was entirely at
variance with the characters of the sufferers, and in the case
of the wife with the fact that suicides do not choose “a long,
lingering, and painful death;” (3) that the prisoner had in
his possession the means of administering poison as well as
the opportunities; (4) that in the three cases in which symptoms
of antimonial poisoning were felt by those who tasted
the cheese, the egg flip, and the tapioca, the prisoner had the
opportunities of dealing with these articles of food before they
were sent to his wife; (5) that in the remnant of one of them&mdash;the
tapioca&mdash;antimony to a large extent was found; (6)
that in a bottle of Battley’s solution found in the pocket of
Mrs. Taylor after her death aconite in deadly proportions was
detected; and (7) that there was a pecuniary motive, paltry
as it might be represented to be, to induce the prisoner to
commit both these murders.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Who, then, he said, put the
antimony into the food? who put that and the aconite into
the Battley’s solution?</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Who, then,” continued the <i>Solicitor-General</i>, “was the murderer?
For there was a murder&mdash;a deliberate, cold-blooded, cruel
murder&mdash;committed in that house. Who was it? We know the
inmates. There were the two students of medicine. I suppose
you may lay them aside as having nothing to do with it. Suspicion
does not attach to them, neither had they the opportunity. The
servants change in the course of the enacting of this dreadful
tragedy&mdash;all but one. Catherine Lattimer was there until the 13th
of February. The poisoning went on after she left&mdash;the deaths
both occurred after she left. She was not the poisoner, nor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
there a breath of suspicion about her. Mary Patterson comes on
the 16th of February. The poisoning, indeed, goes on after she
comes; but it had commenced long before&mdash;weeks before. We,
therefore, lay her aside. There was Mary McLeod, a girl under
seventeen, the only remaining grown person in the house during
the whole course of the administration to which I need refer. I
need not take any notice of the children, who were the only other
inmates of the house. See, then, to what we have come. There
was a murderer in the house&mdash;a murderer practising the dreadful
art of slow poisoning from the end of December till past the middle
of March. The only two grown persons, except the boarders, who
were in the house during that time&mdash;the only two who had access
to the patients&mdash;were the prisoner at the bar and Mary McLeod.
This is narrowing the case to a very short question. I have
excluded every other idea from the case, by fair, legitimate,
convincing argument, upon evidence that is not open to dispute.
I have excluded the notion of natural death. I have established
the fact of death by poison. I have excluded the idea of death by
accident, by suicide, by the administration medicinally. You are
shut up, therefore, to murderous administration.... I find
that the only two who had access to these miserable victims, and
had any opportunity to perpetrate the murders with which they
are charged, were the prisoner and this one girl. Now, pray,
consider, with respect to the wife, upon the question whether or
no the prisoner is not the man clearly proved by irresistible
evidence to be so, what was the nature of the murder? <i>It was a
murder in which you almost detect a doctor’s finger.</i> It is gradual
poisoning&mdash;poisoning so as not to kill but to weaken; leaving
off for a day, and then resuming again&mdash;one day better, two
days worse. During the whole time the patient exhibited the
symptoms of vomiting and purging, the result of the action of
antimony. You have that going on for a long time under the very
eye of a medical man, the husband of the victim, who was in close
attendance upon her. Do you think anybody else&mdash;do you think
a girl of seventeen could have done that deed? She knew nothing
about antimony.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> If she did not do it, the prisoner must have
done it. And what is his case? His case respecting his own
wife, who was thus demonstrably being poisoned by inches under
his very eye during this long period&mdash;what is his case? “I thought
it was gastric fever,” he says. Gastric fever! Nobody could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
thought it was gastric fever. Nothing like gastric fever in it.
Nothing like anything except what it was&mdash;slow, cruel poisoning,
which brought, in the course of two or three months, this poor
woman to the grave, with such an amount of poison in her
body.”</p>

<p class="p1">Referring, then, to the false statements made by the prisoner
in the case of Mrs. Taylor&mdash;that she had tumbled off
her chair in his consulting room in a fit, and been carried up
to bed, when it was proved that she had walked up to her
bedroom from his consulting room&mdash;had during the evening
called to one of the servants to go out and get sausages for
supper&mdash;had had no tumble or fit, and that the doctor himself
knew nothing about her attack till the bell rang violently
three times&mdash;that hot water had been taken up by the servant
to make her vomit&mdash;the strange statement to Dr. Paterson
before the bottle of “Battley” was found in Mrs. Taylor’s
pocket, that she had purchased half-a-pound of it a few days
before&mdash;the false certificate of her death, “paralysis for
twelve hours and apoplexy for one hour,” when there was no
paralysis except the paralytic affection caused by the aconite,
and that was not before she went upstairs at nine o’clock in
the evening, only four hours before her death: then referring
to the tapioca purchased entirely for Mrs. Taylor’s use, into
which antimony was put by some one; the Solicitor-General
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Keep in view that the method of poisoning alleged against the
prisoner here is not the giving a dose that would kill, but the
introducing it into the food in such quantities that the taking
would not kill, but produce sickness merely&mdash;the intention being
to produce and continue the sickness for months, the fatal termination
then supervening. A poisoner in this way practises the
dreadful art successfully, and could not be very apprehensive of
even himself or any one else taking the food accidentally, as it
would only make them sick. He knows that to produce death it
will be necessary to continue it for a long time. Into this tapioca
antimony is introduced&mdash;sufficient to produce sickness in anybody
taking it, but not death. But Mrs. Pritchard does not get
this tapioca. It is taken by Mrs. Taylor, and she is seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
immediately by symptoms of poisoning by antimony. She is sick
in the same way&mdash;I think she expressed it&mdash;as her daughter was;
because the effects were the same. That tapioca was not put
away, as it might be required again; and if Mrs. Pritchard had
wanted tapioca again, she would have got that, and the poisoning
would have been carried on by its means. If anybody else got it,
it would be a misfortune, but not much more. And who could
have introduced it but the master of the house, who was an
adept in such a mode of poisoning.&mdash;I do not know how many, if
more than one, partook of poisoned food; but some food had been
poisoned. I take that for granted, and that it had been taken by
one of the boarders, Connell, I think. But that is not presented
as part of the case. He was one day more or less sick. The
prisoner does not seem to have been alarmed about it&mdash;he does
not seem to have been alarmed even when he himself was sick
upon some occasion in February. He knew very well there was
no occasion for alarm, for sickness was the end of it; that it would
require a long sickness in order to produce anything like a fatal
result.”</p>

<p class="p1">Briefly, then, reviewing the points he had made, the
Solicitor-General concluded his exhaustive address.</p>

<p class="psh">THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Rutherford Clark</i>, in the opening of his speech, urged
on the jury that the enormity of the double crime required it
“to be proved by evidence strong, clear, overwhelming, that
brought home to their minds and consciences, without the
slightest suspicion on the testimony, the guilt of the prisoner,”
and that “the motives assigned for it were not such
as could ever have, in the slightest degree, actuated any
human being to the commission of such hideous offences.”
Whilst he could not deny that he had the opportunity of
committing the crime, he contended “that it went a very
short way&mdash;indeed no way at all&mdash;in even suggesting or
indicating his guilt.”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“If,” he said, “you find a case where crime is committed, and
where the person charged with committing it has made an opportunity
for himself&mdash;has been zealous in obtaining opportunities&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
opportunity is of the greatest possible importance and the
strongest possible evidence; but to say that he has opportunity in
this case is nothing more than to say it was likely, as indeed it
was true, that the husband who was attending the sick bed of his
wife, should carry to her some of her meals, and send up others with
her meals. But that he should do so is, I am sure, nothing
unnatural&mdash;nothing to suggest guilt. It would have been frightfully
suggestive of guilt, if, instead of sending up these meals, and
taking them up himself, he had always chosen some other agent to
carry them up and to administer the food she was taking. If that
had been the case, I should have been inclined to say that the
Crown would have had a case much more strong to indicate
guilt, than they have when, as it is stated here, that he was
administering to the comfort of his wife while upon her death-bed.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p class="p1">On the point that the prisoner was in possession of the
means of poisoning, “he was,” he said, “by profession a
doctor, and had, no doubt, as most doctors have, considerable
quantities of drugs in his possession. Whether he had
more than most medical men kept in their houses was a
matter of opinion, but it was absurd to suppose that he accumulated
these large quantities of most powerful and destructive
poisons&mdash;a minute dose of many of which would have
been fatal&mdash;for the purpose of murder.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“But,” continued <i>Mr. Clark</i>, “it is not unimportant, in considering
this question, and it is very important especially in
considering the argument of the Solicitor-General, that these
poisons were kept, not in any locked press, but, on the contrary,
within the reach of the household. It is a remark I have made, that
there was not one of the poisoned articles of food which ever
reached the lips of Mrs. Taylor or Mrs. Pritchard without passing
through other hands than the prisoner’s, and it is odd enough that,
in regard to each of them, the person who administered it and who
carried away the food left, is this girl, Mary McLeod. It will
not do for the Solicitor-General to say, ‘I have established that
one of two persons must have committed these crimes,’ and that
you can trace the particular finger of the medical man in connection
with them. Probability will never support a conviction. It will
not do for him to say, as regards the death of Mrs. Pritchard, that
it was the act either of the prisoner or Mary McLeod, and that
it was not likely that a girl of under seventeen would have the skill
to do it. Do you not think that he shrinks from the onus of proof
when he accepts this convenient mode of getting rid of the difficulty,
as he must prove that it is one of those two who did it. He must
prove by evidence that it was not Mary McLeod or some one else in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the house, and it was only by showing that it was not Mary
McLeod, that he can bring this charge home, to the prisoner.”
[Mr. Clark then noticed that the question was put to Lattimer
whether she put anything into the tapioca, but that that question
was not put to Mary McLeod.] “It is a singular omission in the
case of the Crown, which necessarily depends upon being able to
select between those two persons, whom the Solicitor-General
stated were the only two who could have committed the murder,
that they did not venture to put the question to exclude upon her
evidence the fact that she might have been guilty. And this is all
the more strong that I shall trace every article of poisoned food
immediately through her hands.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Subsequently he reviewed the evidence as to each of the
three poisoned articles of food.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Let us see,” he said, “about this tapioca:&mdash;it was suggested,
apparently through Mrs. Taylor, that Mrs. Pritchard would like
some. Accordingly some tapioca is brought by a little boy, and
it is brought in, and received by Mary McLeod. She says she
placed it for some short time on the lobby table. Catherine
Lattimer says Mary McLeod took it down to her, but Mary says
Mrs. Taylor did. Now the suggestion of the Crown is that the
prisoner put antimony in this tapioca, so nicely adjusted to the
quantity bought as to produce sickness leading to death, but not
so as to produce death itself. It would certainly have been of
some importance to have shown that he had any opportunity of
administering or putting any poison into it, but it is not proved&mdash;there
is not a shadow of evidence that he had any opportunity, or
to show that he was in the house at the time. He was a man
accustomed to exercise an active profession, and, of course, would
naturally be out at that period of the day; but at all events it is
not shown that he was aware that his wife desired tapioca, or that
his mother-in-law had ordered it. It is not even shown that there
was the least possibility of his introducing antimony into that bag.
It is prepared and carried up by Mary McLeod to her mistress,
who declines to take it, and it is taken by Mrs. Taylor, who was
taken ill after partaking of it.”</p>

<p class="p1">Again, as to the poisoned bit of cheese:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is spoken to by Mary McLeod. She tells you she had taken
up the tray for supper, and that on it was the cheese and other
things which were placed on the table at which Dr. Taylor and the
other inmates of the house are sitting; that she came out, and
that, on returning again, Dr. Pritchard handed to her a piece of
cheese to take to her mistress. She did not see him cut off the
piece of cheese, but he handed it to her sitting at the table; and
it is perfectly obvious it must have been cut off the cheese eaten
by the family at supper. If he placed antimony upon it, it must
have been in the presence of the persons at supper&mdash;a piece of
yellow cheese which must have indicated the powder of tartarised
antimony, if placed upon it.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>&mdash;It was not asked if it were possible
to put this tartarised antimony upon the cheese while sitting at
supper. I leave you to judge if it were possible. It was taken
up oddly enough&mdash;I cannot help noticing the coincidence&mdash;by Mary
McLeod. She says she ate part of it, and that it did her no harm;
but the residue was taken down into the kitchen and eaten by
Patterson, and she suffered from vomiting.”</p>

<p class="p1">Again, as to the poisoned egg-flip:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The doctor comes and tells his servant to prepare some, a
thing not unnatural to be taken by a person with a delicate
stomach, and for a medical man to order. But it is said this was
a plot for Dr. Pritchard to get in his drugs in this way. He supposes
that he went through the dining-room and got the sugar,
and then into the consulting-room, and then into the pantry, and
dropped the pieces of sugar, on which he had put antimony, into
the egg. Does he give any proof of this? Does he suggest anything
more than suspicion? The Crown seems to have doubted
whether he could on the sugar have put in so much antimony as
to have produced the effects which the servant girl says she
suffered. Dr. Littlejohn thought it possible, but he had never
tried the experiment. A possibility at the best&mdash;a large possibility&mdash;that
he could have put in the drug. Was the egg-flip
capable of producing the effects which are said to have been caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
by it? ‘Barely possible,’ according to Dr. Littlejohn. What is its
history: does it pass through his hands? No. It was left by
Patterson in the pantry, and Mary McLeod came down for it to the
kitchen. She was told it was in the pantry, and she goes up to
bring it down again. There, again, you have Mary McLeod intervening
in the matter, notwithstanding the dilemma on which the
Solicitor-General placed his case: she it is who carries it up to the
bedroom, and she it is who administers it to the patient who is
suffering there. There is another remarkable thing in this case.
The amount of antimony introduced must have been a very powerful
dose, because, taking only a teaspoonful of the egg-flip as
Patterson did, she lay vomiting and suffering all night. Mrs. Pritchard
took a wine-glassful, and vomited for about half an hour
afterwards. Surely if a strong woman took only a teaspoonful,
and a weak woman a wine-glassful, she would have been destroyed
by the poison that had so powerful an effect on the former.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Again, with reference to the bottle of Battley’s solution
found in Mrs. Taylor’s dress after her death, into which it
was suggested that the prisoner had put the aconite and antimony
discovered in it, said Mr. Clark:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He knew, no doubt, that she was taking it, but it is not in the
least degree proved that he knew where it was, in what bottle it
was, or where Mrs. Taylor kept the bottle. Mary McLeod did
know, for she bought it for Mrs. Taylor. But what is the ground
of suggestion that aconite had been put into that bottle before
Mrs. Taylor had it? All that you have is that Drs. Maclagan
and Littlejohn say there was, and that they were contradicted by
the person who actually observed its effects. And what became of
this bottle? It was found on her person after her death. Is it
possible to suppose that he had the means of getting at the bottle
before her death to introduce the poison? How could he? It
was carried about her person, and there is not the slightest suggestion
that he ever had access to it; and yet you are asked to act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
upon that suggestion, because it is said, ‘You may probably trace
the administration of a medical hand.’ No: probabilities are not
in this case. It is proof, and proof alone, that we can go on.
What was the history of the bottle? It was found in her clothes,
no doubt, when the body was being dressed by Patterson and Nabb,
and even they did not know the very great quantity, perhaps, that
this old lady had taken. But still more, supposing that she should
take no aconite, she had taken sufficient of the mixture to account
for her death. Assuming that the highest mark on the bottle, as
taken by Dr. Paterson, is a correct one, it would come to be not
less than 2¾ ounces that had been taken. It was shown that the
bottle was put by for some time; but if it was taken away after
the murder, that is of very little consequence. If he had put
antimony in it, would it not have been very easy for him to have
thrown the bottle aside? But instead of that, we have him expressing
his surprise to these two women that she had taken such
a great quantity. He takes away the bottle, and brings it back
again, and there it remains until examined by Dr. Penny, who
then finds that it contains some aconite and antimony. But where
is the shadow of a proof that he put it there? The bottle was
lying open&mdash;was not locked up in any way: it remained in the
house from the death of Mrs. Taylor till after the prisoner was
apprehended, more than a month afterwards. Any person in the
house might have access to it, and yet all that can be suggested to
prove that the prisoner put in this antimony and aconite before
her death was contained in the observation of my learned friend,
that you could trace, or that you could <i>probably</i> trace here, the
finger of a medical man.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The false statement in the certificate of death, Mr. Clark
attributed to a desire of sparing the feelings of the husband.
He did not justify the morality of the act, but, looking at the
circumstances, asked the jury “if there was any degree of
guilty knowledge when he asked Dr. Paterson to inform his
father-in-law of the cause of death, and he was only forced to
take that step by his refusal.” With Dr. Paterson’s manner
in the witness-box he naturally dealt in the most severe
language of reproof and censure.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I do not believe,” he said, in concluding his remarks on this
witness, “he saw any symptoms of poisoning, or he would have
acted as any other medical man would have acted&mdash;unselfishly,
nobly, and generously in this matter. And when you see that
this is inconsistent with the whole conduct of the profession to
which he belongs, I ask you to disbelieve many of the statements
he makes. You cannot rely on these statements, given with a
bias, for he tells you what is incredible, or only credible at the
loss of his own honour, which I am sure he will strive studiously
to guard. He has become a partisan in this matter altogether,
and forgot what is due to his position and his profession. All that
can be said of Dr. Paterson is this,&mdash;that he speaks about the
prisoner, of his mother-in-law, and speaks further about what he
said of her falling; yet even after all, this is merely an account of
a circumstance given by him some months, or, if you like, a month
after the case occurred. And because the prisoner made some
statements not exactly consistent with the truth as now disclosed
on the evidence, are you to believe, on Dr. Paterson’s statement,
and upon his statement only, that these statements were made so
as to show guilty knowledge. I can quite understand that after
there is proof of administration you may support that proof by
evidence of falsehoods which the prisoner may tell, if you have
reliable evidence to prove that they were stated. But when you
have no evidence of administration of poison, then the evidence is
all the other way; then I think you cannot eke out the probabilities
of the case by appealing to these probabilities, or to the falsehoods
depending on evidence like that here, as showing conclusively,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that this prisoner was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
person who committed that foul crime upon the person of his
mother-in-law.”</p>

<p class="p1">Having thus commented on the evidence given for the
prosecution on all the leading points of the case, in masterly,
if not convincing arguments, in conclusion the prisoner’s
counsel dwelt on the admitted terms of affection in which he
lived with his wife and children&mdash;on the impossibility of
believing in his commission of such a cold-blooded murder,
on the evidence adduced. “The whole evidence of the
Crown,” he said, “hangs upon probability, and can never
justify you in believing, in the first place, that he was capable
of committing the crime; and, in the second, it is hardly
conceivable that anything so unnatural should be committed
by such a man.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, the Lord Justice Clerk summed up the
evidence in this protracted trial with great minuteness, in the
course of his charge reading to the jury nearly the whole of
the evidence, and meeting the various objections to its relevancy
offered by the prisoner’s counsel. There were three
points, he said, for their consideration. (1.) Did the two
ladies, or either of them, die from poison? (2.) If aye, was
that poison administered for the purpose of destroying life?
(3.) Was it the prisoner who administered it?</p>

<p>On the first point, after calling their attention in detail to
the medical and analytical evidence in the case of Mrs. Pritchard,
that she died from slow antimonial poisoning, he said,
did not appear to have been contested by the prisoner’s
counsel, and, upon the evidence, he did not think it admitted
of a doubt. As the evidence showed that it was not from a
large dose of antimony taken lately before death that she had
died, the idea of accident or mistake was excluded. That it
might have arisen from unskilful treatment by the prisoner
was negatived by his assertion that he had never administered
antimony to her, except once externally in October last, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
could have nothing to do with the state in which the intestines
were found in March. The idea of suicide by slow
poisoning, even if there had been any hint of a suicidal tendency
on Mrs. Pritchard’s part, was equally inadmissible:
she must, if killed by antimony, have had it administered to
her for that purpose. In Mrs. Taylor’s case, into the details
of which he fully entered, one was almost forced to the conclusion
that her death was brought about by the combined
action of aconite, antimony, and opium. As to the idea of
accident in her case it was inconsistent with the fact that the
Battley’s solution was pure when bought. “Was it then,”
he added, “by accident that these two subtle poisons, aconite
and antimony, found their way into her medicine-bottle: if
not by accident, did she put them there herself, or had she
any knowledge of such things as to enable her, if she were willing,
so to poison herself by using her own medicine? There
was no appearance of that, and the character and conduct of
the old lady, her natural condition both of body and mind as
you heard it described by the witnesses, is such as not to
suggest the idea of suicide in her case as a possibility at all.
Consider, then, with reference to both deaths, whether you
can arrive at the conclusion, or whether you can resist the
conclusion, that the poison by the means of which they were
deprived of life was wilfully given to them for the very purpose
of destroying life.”</p>

<p>Passing then to the third question, “Was the poison of which
these ladies died administered to them by the prisoner?”
the Lord Justice Clerk went with great minuteness through
the painful details of Mrs. Pritchard’s long and lingering
illness, the symptoms which it exhibited, the prisoner’s misrepresentation
of it as gastric fever, when the medical men
proved that there was no fever in the case, but clear signs of
antimonial poisoning, and the various acts of the prisoner
during it which were put forward as showing that he had,
and that he used, the opportunities his position offered, for
the purpose of administering the poison. The interest of
this portion of the charge, as well as of that relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
symptoms and death of Mrs. Taylor, and the prisoner’s conduct
in relation to it, depends so entirely on the judge’s
method of marshalling the evidence, already reported, that it
could not be satisfactorily given except verbatim. Many of
the remarks of the learned judge, on these points of the evidence,
have already been reported in the notes. It will therefore
be sufficient to give, here, his remarks on the question of
motive, and on the suggestion of the prisoner’s counsel with
regard to Mary McLeod.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In regard to the matter of motive, I would suggest to you
that the motive that his pecuniary difficulties would be relieved by
the death of Mrs. Taylor, does not seem to have been made out
satisfactorily. You will consider the evidence, but I confess I do
not think it worth while to set it before you again. Then, the question
comes to be, was there a motive? What is there in the shape
of a motive that may be supposed to account for the perpetration
of two such horrid crimes? That is the way it was stated, and ably
stated, by the prisoner’s counsel. But there are some considerations
applicable to that part of the case which I am bound to suggest to
you. The absence of motive, in the ordinary sense of the word, is
not a very uncommon thing in the experiences of a criminal court.
In truth, the existence of any adequate motive for the perpetration
of a great crime is a thing impossible. Still there may be what is
called an intelligent motive&mdash;the existence of some foul passion,
or some immediate and strong excitement, which, in a moment of
half frenzy, drives a man to the commission of murder. These are
all very evident and intelligible incentives to crime. But when
we find that, in the opinion of the prisoner’s counsel, there is no
motive, it means no more than this, that the motive has not been
discovered. There must have been a motive or incentive, and yet
we may never discover what it was. You are never in a condition
to say that there was no motive, but only that the motive was not
discovered; and the motives of human action, we know from
history and experience, are often inscrutable. Another motive or
incentive has been suggested&mdash;the illicit relation between himself
and Mary McLeod. This is a very important part of the case
undoubtedly, and one to which you are bound to give due attention.
The prosecution suggests that the existence of that intercourse
was the reason or the desire that led him to get rid of his wife.
If that was the incentive, I do not think there will be much
difficulty in explaining the incentive to the commission of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
other murder; because her presence in the course of the chronic
poisoning of his wife would have been a great obstruction and
interference with his plans.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> But it is for you to say whether it
is a sufficient motive. It is a fair question for your consideration,
and I should desire you to turn your minds to it very seriously;
keeping only in mind this view, that even supposing you find it
impossible to assign an intelligible motive for the commission of
one or both of these murders, the absence of evidence of motive is
not sufficient reason for acquitting the prisoner, if you are satisfied
from the other evidence in the case that he was guilty. Motive,
after all, can but create a presumption one way or another. It is
not evidence of the fact of murder, that a man has an obvious
motive to commit it; and just as little can the absence of proof of
the existence of a motive be a reason for finding the prisoner not
guilty, if the evidence of the fact of the murder be satisfactory
against him.”</p>

<p class="p1" >Again, after having shown how no imputation could rest on
the servants Lattimer and Patterson, the learned judge thus
dealt with the imputation thrown out by the prisoner’s counsel
against Mary McLeod:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He has said that there was another girl there who stands in
a very different position, and that it appears, singularly enough,
that whenever an article of food was to be carried to Mrs. Pritchard,
Mary McLeod’s is the hand that bears it. In short, if I understand
aright his theory, it is Mary McLeod who caused these murders,
and he invites you to choose between her and the prisoner, and to
pronounce upon a balance of probabilities which of the two it was.
This is a very painful position for you to be placed in. If it be
necessary that you should decide absolutely between the two it
must be done. <i>At the same time the prisoner’s counsel did not seem
sufficiently to advert, in considering the point, to the possibility that
both might have been implicated, and, if that was so, I suppose we
should have little doubt which was the master and which was the
servant; and, although the one might be the active hand that administered
the poison, if two were concerned, you would have very little
doubt who was the actor, and who set on the other. And, in fact, if
you should arrive at this conclusion, every article that the prisoner’s
counsel alluded to for the purpose of throwing the guilt on Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
McLeod would be an article of evidence to implicate the prisoner at
the bar.</i> But I do not desire you to take this theory. On the
contrary, I think it quite right that you should consider on the
balance of probabilities, as has been very well said, which of the
two is the perpetrator of this crime; and in considering this,
it is necessary for you to advert to this&mdash;that the poison was
administered in doses&mdash;in doses any one of which was insufficient to
kill, but which was quite sufficient, in the agony it produced, and
by the gradual reduction of the strength of the patient, at length
to lead to a fatal termination. Is it conceivable that a girl of
fifteen or sixteen years of age, in the position of a servant maid,
could of herself have conceived and executed such a design, within
this house, under the eye and subject to the vigilance of the husband
of her victim, himself a medical man? That is very hard to believe.
On the other hand, if you can suppose that the prisoner was the
person who conceived and executed this wicked design, it is not so
difficult to believe that Mary McLeod may have been the perfectly
unconscious instrument of carrying out his purpose&mdash;suspecting
nothing, knowing nothing of what was being done, and seeing
nothing but great kindness on the part of the prisoner to her
mistress, and seeing them dying, not rapidly as in the case of
Mrs. Pritchard, and though rapidly in that of Mrs. Taylor, still
in a way the prisoner accounted for as a medical man. You
may understand easily enough that a girl in the position of Mary
McLeod might be made the unconscious means of carrying out
these designs, and perfectly innocent on her part. But there is no
difficulty in this question. If you are satisfied that murder was
committed, somebody did it. Some of them are plainly innocent,
and therefore the probability of guilt is reduced to two. Of these
two, one or both of them are guilty of this deed.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then with a remark on the suggestion of the prisoner’s
counsel, that Mrs. Taylor died of an overdose of opium in
the Battley’s solution, the learned judge left the case to the
jury, who, after about an hour’s deliberation, found the
prisoner “Guilty,” and he was sentenced to death.</p>

<p>After his conviction, in the hopes of exciting commiseration,
Pritchard drew up a confession implicating Mary
McLeod, but the transparent falsehood failing to gain for it
any credence, he was induced to put forward a second, and,
subsequently, a third and apparently full confession of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
guilt. In this last he made the following statements: “I
am guilty of the death of my mother-in-law, Mrs. Taylor, and
of my wife. I can assign no motive for the conduct which
actuated me, beyond a species of ‘terrible madness,’ and the
use of ‘ardent spirits.’ I hereby freely and fully state that
the confession made on the 11th of this month (implicating
McLeod) was not true, and I confess that I alone, and not
M. McLeod, poisoned my wife in the way brought out in the
evidence at the trial. Mrs. Taylor’s death was caused according
to the wording of the indictment and the main facts
brought out at my trial. I hereby fully acknowledge and
now plead wholly and solely <i>guilty thereto</i>, and may God have
mercy on my soul.” He was executed on the 27th of July,
at Glasgow, in the sight, it was reported at the time, of nearly
one hundred thousand persons.</p>

<p class="psh">FIRST TRIAL&mdash;<i>July 7 and 8.</i></p>

<p>Thomas Smethurst, æt. 48, surgeon, was indicted for the
wilful murder of Isabella Bankes. The prisoner was a person
of small stature and insignificant appearance, with reddish-brown
moustaches, probably older than he stated, and, though
appearing careworn, maintained great self-possession throughout
the proceedings, and especially during the second trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p>Serjeant Ballantine, in stating the case to the jury, said it
was alleged that the prisoner took away the life of a fellow
creature by poison, and likewise contrived to throw around
the means employed to destroy life some more than ordinary
difficulties in the way of the detection of the crime; that in
order to effect this purpose he had availed himself of the
knowledge he possessed, and made use of a slow irritant
poison, which he had administered with his own hands, until,
by the accumulation of poison and irritation, she died.</p>

<p>The prisoner was represented to be a member of the medical
profession: he had considerable knowledge of medicine,
and was known as Dr. Smethurst. He was a married man,
and had a wife considerably older than himself now living.
At the time when he should first refer to Dr. Smethurst, he
was living with his wife in a respectable lodging-house in
Bayswater. While they were living there, in the autumn of
1858, Miss Isabella Bankes also came there to reside. She
was a lady of delicate constitution,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and possessed of property
under her own control of between £1,700 and £1,800, and a
life interest in £5,000, which, at her death, went to other
members of her family. The result was that an intimacy
sprung up between the parties. In November of that year,
the landlady, considering that there was too great intimacy
between Miss Bankes and the doctor, spoke to her, and, in
consequence, she left the house. On the 9th of December,
Miss Bankes and the prisoner went through the form of
marriage at Battersea Church, and, two days after, commenced
to reside at Richmond. From a letter to his wife
found on him when in custody, it was evident that the doctor
did not intend this to be a permanent marriage. Until the
28th of January, 1859, nothing was heard of them; then
Miss Bankes’s sister Louisa received a letter from her, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
not dated from the place where they were living. On the
15th of February, the sister received another letter from her.
At that time they were living in Old Palace Gardens, Richmond.
Miss Bankes was then in good health, but, about the
28th of March, her illness commenced. On the 3rd of April,
Dr. Smethurst determined to have medical advice. The landlady
advised Dr. Julius, as he and his partner, Dr. Bird, were
the most eminent practitioners in Richmond. They were
accordingly called in. The former treated her for diarrhœa,
in the usual way, the complaint from which he understood
she was suffering, taking his account of her symptoms from
Dr. Smethurst. Dr. Julius all through consulted with the
prisoner, who took a most active part in the matter, and
sometimes pressed upon him the use of various medicines.
He, however, was only on two occasions allowed to be alone
with his patient. On the 15th of April, on the landlady at
Old Palace Gardens asking a few shillings more rent, they removed
to Alma Villas&mdash;Miss Bankes so weak that she had to
be taken in a cab and carried upstairs. Dr. Julius, when he
found that his remedies had a contrary effect to what was
intended, asked Dr. Bird to see her, but did not mention his
own suspicions, though they were very strong. On the 18th
of April Dr. Bird saw her, prescribed for her, but with the
same result as his partner. At this time she was sinking,
and becoming continually weaker. On that day the prisoner
wrote a letter to her sister Louisa marked “private and confidential.”
It stated that her sister was very ill, and wished
to see her: she was to ask for Dr. and Mrs. Smethurst, and
not to breathe a word of the contents of the note to anyone.
The sister was not at this time aware of the marriage, and
had her own views of her sister’s conduct. She went, however,
and found her sister in a very feeble state. The deceased
said to her, “Oh, don’t say anything about it; it will
be all right when I get well, won’t it dear?” turning to
Dr. Smethurst, who said, “Yes, it will be all right soon.”
Dr. Smethurst showed every kindness and attention to the
deceased during her illness, and to the time of her death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
she treated him with love and affection. Miss Louisa, however,
was never allowed to be for a moment alone with
her sister. Whilst she was there the prisoner gave the
patient a saline draught, and she vomited immediately, and
complained of its bad taste. Miss Louisa offered to make
some tapioca, but the prisoner objected on the ground that
there was not any milk. She then offered to make some
arrowroot, but again he objected on the ground that the landlady
might not like it. That evening the sister left, and next
day wrote to the deceased, to which letter she received the
following reply from the prisoner:&mdash;“After your departure,
dear Bella had a very bad evening and night of it, purely from
the excitement of seeing you, and the fatigue consequent
thereon. Vomiting and purging set in at a fearful rate,
which of course prostrated her greatly. The doctor at once
forbade any visitors for the present, or he would not be responsible
for the effects attendant thereon.” The prisoner had no
doubt made such representations to Dr. Bird as induced him
to say that she had better not receive visitors for the present.
On subsequent days the sister received other letters from the
prisoner postponing her intended visits from time to time;
describing her sister’s condition, and mentioning that he had
insisted on having a consultation with “Dr. Todd, the first
physician of the day, and the two regular attendants who
were the first doctors in the place.” One of these letters was
dated April 30, but made no mention of his having on that
day instructed an attorney in Richmond to draw up a will
upon what he said was a draft by a barrister in London, but
was really entirely in his own handwriting. On the following
day (Sunday) he called on the attorney, and, representing
that the case was urgent, induced him to come to the lodging,
where the will was formally executed. By this will the whole
of her property was left to the prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The consultation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
with Dr. Todd took place, and he agreed with other medical
attendants that the patient was suffering from unfair treatment.
The prisoner, however, on the 29th, wrote to the
sister that Dr. Todd not only acquiesced in what was being
done, but recommended a perseverance of the treatment, with
some slight additions of his own. This was not the fact, but
the prisoner was not made aware of the suspicions entertained
by the medical attendants. They, however, caused the evacuations
of the deceased to be tested, and the result was so confirmatory
of their views, that they communicated with the
police, and the prisoner was arrested. A number of bottles
containing drugs and medicines were taken possession of, and
on his person was found the following letter to his wife, sealed
and stamped for post:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Mary</span>,&mdash;I have not been able to leave for town as

strong enough to justify his committal, the prisoner
was discharged. On the following day, the 3rd of May, Miss
Bankes died, a coroner’s inquest was held, and the result was
the re-arrest of the prisoner, and his subsequent committal
for wilful murder, for which he was put on his trial on the
7th of July.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF MEDICAL ATTENDANTS.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Julius</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He was called in on the 3rd of April to the deceased, who
was represented to be suffering from vomiting and diarrhœa. The
prisoner said he believed that her liver was overloaded with bile.
The witness prescribed accordingly, but without any abatement of
the symptoms. There was no appearance of bile in the evacuations
after the third or fourth day that he saw her, yet the symptoms
of diarrhœa and vomiting continued, with a burning sensation in
the bowels and soreness of the mouth. She complained of a
parching throat and a burning thirst. He could not account for
any of these appearances from any natural disease, and began to
entertain an opinion that something of an irritant character was
being administered, and in consequence desired that his partner,
Dr. Bird, should see her. Did not communicate his suspicions to
Dr. Bird, who, taking the prisoner’s account of the symptoms,
and knowing the witness’s prescriptions, adopted his mode of treatment,
but with the same want of success. The medicines were
varied, but the symptoms continued the same. On this the witness
communicated his fears to Dr. Bird, and he on further observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
agreed that the patient was suffering from some irritant, of the
administration of which they knew nothing. During this period
the prisoner always saw the medical attendants, and was always
present in the room when they were with the patient, and
recommended or dissuaded the use of various medicines. He
displayed a considerable knowledge of medicine. On the 28th of
April the patient was very ill, and she repeatedly said to Dr. Bird in
the prisoner’s presence that she should like some one else to be
called in. On the same day the prisoner (who had always expressed
a desire that the best medical advice should be obtained) suggested
that Dr. Todd should be called in. On Dr. Todd’s arrival, witness
gave him an outline of the case and treatment, but did not say
anything of the suspicions that had arisen in his mind. Subsequent
to Dr. Todd’s attendance witness procured some of the
evacuations, and in consequence of the examination of them,
thought it his duty to communicate with the magistrates, and the
prisoner was arrested, but released on his own recognizances.
Witness was unable to ascribe the symptoms to any natural
cause, but if small doses of some irritant poison were administered
from time to time, it would have accounted for all the appearances
that had exhibited themselves. Antimony and arsenic would be
the character of poisons likely to produce such results. <i>There was
neither antimony nor arsenic in any of the medicines he prescribed
for her.</i> The prisoner told him that she was not in the family
way. Dr. Todd had prescribed a pill containing a quarter of a
grain of sulphate of copper and a quarter of a grain of opium, to
which the prisoner objected, as the copper often produced
symptoms of poisoning. On the Saturday the prisoner said this
medicine had produced intense burning in the mouth and throat,
constant vomiting, and fifteen bloody motions&mdash;that the burning
was from the “mouth to the anus.” In my judgment it could
not have produced these effects. The evacuation which I obtained
was previous to her taking any of these pills, as they did not
arrive until afterwards. When in prison Dr. Smethurst wrote to
me three letters for the particulars of the medicines that had been
given, which I answered. In the first he also wished to know
what solutions of arsenic were kept in our surgery, <i>and in the third
letter ashed for the date of the prescription for antimony, which had
never been prescribed</i>. He also told me that she had been ill just
a week&mdash;that previously she had been in very good health, able
to take long walks, in fact out a good deal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On his <i>cross-examination, Dr. Julius</i></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Admitted that Smethurst’s communications to him of the
symptoms were made in the clearest and plainest manner, and
tallied with his own observations&mdash;that twice he believed he
saw the patient without the prisoner being present; that previous
to the 15th of April the prisoner had suggested to the
witness that Drs. Hills or Hassell should be called in, and a
different treatment&mdash;one of a very sedative character, which the
witness considered as too powerful, and, therefore, gave in a more
diluted form; that witness had not, whilst in attendance on Miss
Bankes, the slightest suspicion of her pregnancy, but that, if he
had known of it, he should not have made any difference in his
treatment, and now that he did know of it, it made no difference
in his opinion as to the cause of her death. Whilst admitting
that the delivery of a woman who had a first child at the age of
forty-three would be very critical, he stated decidedly, as the result
of his experience, that the period of pregnancy would be far less
critical than in a younger woman. Vomiting was well-known to
be an early&mdash;the earliest&mdash;sign of pregnancy, but diarrhœa was
not; and though he had heard of a case in which it was accompanied
with diarrhœa, he had not heard of one in which the
diarrhœa would not yield to any ordinary treatment, and the life
of the mother was only saved by the destruction of the fœtus.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination Dr. Julius</i> stated that “vomiting in
early pregnancy had nothing to do with the burning sensation
in the mouth and throat; <i>that the sickness of Miss Bankes
was decidedly not of the same character as that of pregnancy,
nor was the diarrhœa such as pregnant women sometimes
suffer from</i>.” Dr. Bird, and not the witness, prescribed bismuth,
acetate of lead, and nitrate of silver.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Bird</i>, who from service in the Crimea in 1855 had
had great experience and opportunity of studying bowel complaints,
confirmed the evidence of his partner.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“None of the symptoms were in his opinion reconcileable with
any known disease, but were such as could be accounted for from
the administration of small doses of antimony or arsenic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
prisoner, he said, told him, on one occasion, that the deceased had
seen her sister, and that it had very much excited her, and in
consequence witness told him that it would be better if she did
not come again. On the 30th he told the prisoner that he wished
to take away a portion of one of her evacuations, that it might be
examined under the microscope to see if any purulent matter was
in it, that we might judge if there was any ulceration of the bowels&mdash;that
the prisoner poured out a portion into a tumbler, which he
tied over with an old newspaper, and that the witness took it to his
surgery, marked it No. 2, sealed it with his own seal, and preserved
it intact until delivered to Dr. Taylor with the bottle No. 1 which
Dr. Julius had obtained. A third portion of an evacuation was
shown to him by the prisoner, which he put into a white jam-pot,
and marked No. 3. He was downstairs at the moment Miss Bankes
died, but saw her every minute or two before that. He gave an
ample quantity of every ingredient used in his prescriptions so as
to afford a sufficient opportunity for analyzation.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, he described the various remedies he
prescribed, none of which would account for the symptoms,
and stated that he formed his opinion that it was a case of
slow poisoning by an irritant, not only from what Dr. Julius
and the prisoner told him, but from the vomitings, the motions,
and the lady’s own account of her symptoms.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Caudle</i>, the assistant of Messrs. Julius and Bird, described
the medicines he compounded, and <i>Dr. Buzzard</i>
detailed the transmission of the bottles of evacuations to
Dr. Taylor.</p>


<p class="psh"><i>POST-MORTEM</i> EXAMINATION.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barwell</i>, Assistant-Surgeon of the Charing Cross
Hospital, who, with Mr. Palmer, of Mortlake, made a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination of the body on the 4th of May, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I found the back part of the body externally of a dark purple,
being full of blood from the position in which the body lay:
I gathered from that that the blood was more fluid, I should say,
than usual. The arms were perfectly flexible; legs very rigid;
feet bent downwards and turned in, and the muscles at their
bottoms very rigid, indicating cramp or spasm in the lower
extremities; the abdomen drawn in and the muscles tense and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
hard; the tongue rough, and the <i>papillæ</i> more elevated than usual.
There were no signs of what I could call aphthœ; the face was
much emaciated and of a dull earthy colour; lower lip drawn in
under the upper teeth; front of the body generally of this dull
earthy colour; brain perfectly healthy; nothing wrong about the
lungs&mdash;they were healthy. I saw that the liver was firm, full-sized,
rather large, but did not then cut into it. I examined the uterus,
and found the common signs of pregnancy and a fœtus of somewhere
between the fifth and seventh week; the heart and great
vessels connected with it were perfectly healthy. <i>I examined the
liver subsequently; it was slightly fatty, rather fatty; the remainder
hard. The liver when it becomes fatty is usually soft, but in this
instance it was hard, and it was coloured in the usual manner&mdash;speckled.</i>
Gullet healthy, no signs of inflammation on it. The
outside of the stomach, the smaller end, that nearer the intestine,
was red; the larger end, that where the gullet enters, was of a dark
colour; in the centre it was pale. On examining the inside of the
stomach, the narrow part or small end was also red; at the larger
end was a black patch of effused blood; near the small end the
mucous membrane was congested, that is the other end from the
black spot and near where the red was. The contents of the
stomach were a brown mucus mixed with blood and some bile, I
should say. There were no ulcers in the stomach, nor appearance
of acute inflammation. On the outside of the intestine I noticed
on the 4th of May (the first examination) that its commencement
was very red, the small intestines generally were inflated and
minutely injected with blood, and in certain spots they were
roughened by lymph, the result of inflammation, and glued together
at certain turns where this lymph or glutinous inflammation was
effused; they were coherent together from that cause; that did
not apply to the entire length of the intestines, only to a few
parts, and chiefly quite the lower parts. Those are the external
symptoms. Internally, the first part of the intestine (the <i>duodenum</i>)
was inflamed for about three inches from its commencement, but
the mucous membrane was quite firm, and there was no ulceration.
From that point the rest of the mucous membrane was only slightly
injected, not inflamed. In the next intestine, the <i>jejunum</i>, the
mucous membrane was still firm; in places the vessels were injected
with its own blood, but this only in spots. In the <i>ilium</i>, or lower intestine,
there was much the same appearance at the commencement
as in the last, <i>except that approaching the lower part the injections
increased very much, and at last, about 3 feet from its end, the
mucous membrane was greatly altered; there was a deposit of lymph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
therein, and a thickening of the membrane; an ill-organized granular
lymph; the membrane at the same time was roughened, and the glands,
which are in the intestine there, were less visible than usual</i>. This
deposit of lymph did not begin in the glands, but went over
the whole surface of the intestine, and concealed the glands instead
of rendering them more prominent&mdash;instead of being deposited in
the glands, was rather around them at first. <i>This brings me to the</i>
cæcum. <i>On its mucous membrane were many very large spots. The
appearances within the</i> cæcum <i>indicated very serious disease indeed&mdash;inflammation,
sloughing, ulceration, and suppuration.</i> Those appearances
diminished as I went lower down the intestines. <i>When
I reached the termination, the</i> colon, <i>there was still ulceration, but in
a minor degree. In the</i> rectum <i>there were three ulcerations. I should
also say that in the</i> cæcum <i>were black spots of effused blood, which
were also found along the rest and in the</i> rectum. I have heard the
evidence given of the symptoms exhibited during life, and the
treatment adopted. Taking those into consideration, and the
<i>post-mortem</i> appearances, they are not reconcileable with any
natural disease with which I am acquainted.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“What is the conclusion you have formed?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>That the symptoms and appearances together have
resulted from some irritant, administered frequently during life.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In his <i>cross-examination</i>, the earlier portion of which was
occupied with questions to test the accuracy of the notes of
his report, the witness explained that the hardness of the
liver, which he observed, was not a stage of <i>Cirrhosis</i>, as he
had at first written in his memoranda, “but a normal hardness,
nothing extraordinary;” that the use of the term
“hard” did not imply that the liver was diseased, but that
the term “fatty” does.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Sergeant Ballantine.</i>&mdash;“I think I understood you to convey
that there were no signs of disease about the liver, except this
fattiness?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No signs at all except that. That is not a disease of
a nature to affect the <i>cæcum</i> and the intestines in any way.”</p>

<p><i>By the Court.</i>&mdash;“Is it in any way connected with diarrhœa and
vomiting?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Samuel Wilks</i>, who had subsequently examined the intestines
with <i>Mr. Barwell</i>, confirmed his statements as to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
condition and that of the liver, and “should think Miss Bankes’
death was most probably to be attributed to an irritant.”</p>

<p>On <i>cross-examination</i>, he allowed that “severe dysentery
produces great inflammation of the intestines, particularly of
the larger; that inflammation, if continued, results in ulceration
and destruction of the tissues; that the <i>cæcum</i> and
<i>rectum</i> would be affected in that way by dysentery, and that
dark spots of effused blood are also a consequence of severe
dysentery.” His admission, however, rested on his reading,
and not from his experience of cases of acute dysentery, as
he had seen only “two cases, which they were obliged to call
by that name, not being able to arrive at any other conclusion
as to the cause of death.”</p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL EXPERTS FOR THE PROSECUTION.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Todd</i>, Physician to King’s College Hospital, was then
called.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Dr. Julius,” he said, “told him the nature of the case before
he saw the deceased, but not his suspicions. When he saw her he
noticed a peculiar expression of countenance&mdash;an expression of
terror, as though she were under the influence of some one, and
that was not in accordance with the appearance of a patient
suffering under an ordinary disease. The abdomen was very hard&mdash;an
indication of extensive inflammation in the stomach&mdash;and he
was at once under the impression that she was suffering from some
irritant poison. By witness’s desire an evacuation was obtained,
and he directed Dr. Julius to make up the sulphate of copper and
opium pills to allay irritation. He had never known any bad
effect produced by these medicines, and did not think it could
produce a burning sensation in the throat and stomach. If the
disease had been diarrhœa, the medicines administered by Dr. Julius
were the proper ones.”</p>

<p><i>Sergeant Ballantine.</i>&mdash;“From all you have heard of this case,
what in your opinion was the cause of this lady’s death?”</p>

<p><i>Dr. Todd.</i>&mdash;“<i>I believe that her death was caused by the administration
of some irritant poison, such as arsenic, antimony, or corrosive
sublimate. The only natural disease that would account for the
symptoms is what would be called acute dysentery.</i>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination, Dr. Todd</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have never known any case or cases of early pregnancy of a
woman of about forty to forty-five years of age in which there has
been violent vomiting, violent diarrhœa, and severe dysentery,
which no ordinary medicines would stop, and in which the life of
the mother has only been saved by the abortion of the fœtus. No
such cases have come under my cognizance. I think it possible
that excessive vomiting and great diarrhœa may be caused by the
early stage of pregnancy, and symptoms somewhat allied to those
under which this lady died; <i>but I think it quite impossible that
pregnancy alone, in an early stage, or in any stage, could, produce
extensive ulceration of the bowels</i>. <i>I think, where it is a doubtful
case, it is conclusive evidence against the theory that the symptoms
were caused by early pregnancy that you found such extensive
ulceration as existed in this case.</i>”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Buzzard</i>, who had been a staff-surgeon in the Crimea,
<i>Dr. Copland</i>, and <i>Dr. Bowerbank</i>, who had had great experience
of acute dysentery in tropical climates, gave it as their
opinion that the symptoms were not reconcileable with that
disease, but were those of the presence of irritant poison.
<i>Dr. Babington</i>, Physician to Queen Charlotte’s Lying-in
Hospital, who had attended more than 2,000 women in their
confinement, did not consider that the death was in any way
attributable to the fact of her being in an incipient state of
pregnancy. On <i>cross-examination</i>, whilst admitting that
cases of violent vomiting and diarrhœa in early pregnancy are
recorded, said that he did not remember any one of so severe
a character as to endanger life; that he did not think that the
lady’s advanced stage of life had anything to do with it; that
it was a complication generally at a later period of pregnancy;
and that a first pregnancy between 40 and 45 years of age
was not more critical in the early stage. On <i>re-examination</i>,
with reference to six cases of dysentery, in 1841, in which he
had made <i>post-mortem</i> examinations, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“There was not the same amount of sloughing of the <i>cæcum</i> as
in this case, nor destruction of the mucous membrane. The glands
were in a different condition. In the dysentery cases, the glands
were quite destroyed, and in three of the cases there was perforation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
of the intestine. The symptoms in all six were different to those
in this case; there was no burning sensation of the throat.”</p>

<p class="psh">ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p><i>Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor.</i>&mdash;“On the 1st of May,” said the
witness, “Mr. Buzzard called on me, and brought me two bottles,
which he said contained matters he wished me to examine. I took
about two drachms from one of these bottles (No. 2), and having
first examined the test and the vessel to be employed, and ascertained
that they were pure, I then made the test, and discovered a
metallic deposit on the copper wire, which, in my opinion, indicated
the presence of arsenic or antimony; but I could not speak to the
exact metal. I did not proceed further at that time, as I desired
to have the authority of a magistrate. Bottle No. 2 was then
resealed in my presence by Mr. Buzzard, and taken away by him
with bottle No. 1. After he left, as I was told that it was necessary
to do something to save the life of a living person, though it was
Sunday, I proceeded with my experiment by boiling copper gauze in
the remainder of the liquid in the tube, and on examining it with
a microscope, saw appearances closely resembling metallic arsenic;
and I then heated a portion of the gauze covered with metal in a
tube, and obtained crystals of arsenic (wire gauze with the crystals
on it produced). If you take the tube out, under the microscope
the crystals are perfectly clear; in this little sediment, if you put
it against a dark cloth, you will see a little ring of crystals&mdash;it is
quite plain in the sun light. I subsequently applied the test of
nitrate of silver and nitric acid to crystals obtained in the same
way, and the result convinced me that they were composed of
arsenic. Next day Dr. Buzzard brought back the bottles with the
magistrate’s order. I then proceeded with the examination of
both bottles, and the result perfectly satisfied me that I was
correct in discovering arsenic in bottle 2. My calculation was that
there must have been at least a quarter of a grain mixed with the
four ounces of matter in bottle 2.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> There was no trace of mercury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
bismuth, or antimony, but I did discover the presence of copper
by a subsequent test; but only such a trace of it as might be
accounted for from the copper pill taken on the 29th. I examined
the evacuation, and came to the conclusion that it was such as
would pass from a person who had taken arsenic, and I immediately
advised that the antidote for arsenic, hydrate of magnesia, should be
administered. I subsequently examined the other bottle, and found
that it did not contain any poison or any metallic matter whatever.</p>

<p>“On the 5th and 7th of May Inspector McIntyre brought me
a portion of the viscera of a human being, which I subsequently
submitted to chemical examination. The officer also gave me a
number of bottles, and several pill boxes which I numbered, and
subsequently some more. There were altogether twenty-eight;
and on the 14th of May others which I also numbered. In none
of the twenty-eight, omitting Nos. 5 and 21, did I discover anything
at all necessary you should be acquainted with. I examined
them for arsenic. I then examined the bottles containing the
viscera:&mdash;first, the <i>uterus</i>, which I did not analyse, but agree with
Mr. Barwell as to its impregnation; then the <i>œsophagus</i>, or gullet,
in which there were indications of some cause of irritation, but no
arsenic or antimony; <i>then the</i> stomach, <i>containing yellowish fluid
with blood, and found antimony in two distinct places in the small
intestines; the middle portion of the small intestines contained the
largest quantity, the other part was above and below; some was found
above and below that and some in the</i> cæcum; <i>altogether the amount
found in the stomach was very small. In one kidney and in the
blood of the heart there were traces of antimony, and in the blood in
the jar</i>. I was assisted by Dr. Odling, and we came to the
conclusion that the quantity did not exceed from a quarter to half
a grain. I found the appearance of the stomach and <i>cæcum</i> such
as Mr. Barwell has described. I then examined the medicines
prescribed by Dr. Julius, and found them to contain the ingredients
of which they were represented to be composed. I then examined
bottle No. 5, and found it to contain 355 grains of chlorate of potash,
and free from anything else. That bottle has been accidentally
broken in half. I then examined another bottle, No. 21, which
appeared to contain a clear watery liquid of a saline taste, and I
tested a portion of the contents by Reintsch’s test, and upon first
trying the copper it was entirely consumed.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> I made a further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
examination which led me to conclude that there was arsenic in
the solution, but it turned out that I was mistaken, and that it
did not contain either arsenic or antimony, and that the arsenical
appearances originally produced came from the copper gauze. By
the destruction of the gauze the arsenic in it was set free, and this
destroyed the effect of the experiment. <i>The quantity of arsenic
that I discovered, I should say, was less than half a grain.</i> In the
experiment I made with this bottle, the arsenic was deposited by
myself. Dr. Odling also came to the same conclusion&mdash;that the
bottle contained arsenic, and we both stated that fact in our
examination before the magistrates and the coroner, but we were,
of course, mistaken. We believed, no doubt, at the time, that the
arsenic we found was in the bottle which contained chlorate of
potash&mdash;a cooling mixture. I have used the same description of
gauze for many years, and have never before found arsenic in it.
I shall certainly continue to use it, but shall take care not to do so
with chlorate of potass.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Serjeant Parry</i> here called for the deposition of Dr. Taylor
made before the magistrates, a portion of which was read. It
stated that he had discovered arsenic in bottle No. 21, in
which there was chlorate of potass; that the latter was a
harmless saline mixture acting upon the kidneys, and that if
poison had been given in it, its effect would probably be to
carry off the noxious ingredient from the body very quickly, but
that by repetition constantly of such a proceeding chronic inflammation
would be created which would yield to no treatment,
and would end in the death of the patient from exhaustion.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Taylor</i> then continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“At the time I gave this evidence I firmly believed that arsenic
was contained in the mixture and that it had not come from my
test, but had been placed there by some one. When before the
coroner I expressed my opinion that the death was referable to
antimony and arsenic. <i>The finding of the arsenic in the bottle did
not have any effect upon the opinion I subsequently formed with
reference to the case.</i> The moment I discovered the mistake I had
made I informed Serjeant Ballantine. No arsenic was found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
the body of deceased. I did not form my theory to account for
the absence of arsenic from the tissues of the body, that it had
been carried off by the chlorate of potass. It did not enter into
my consideration beyond this, that it acts generally as a diuretic.
After Dr. Odling and myself had given our evidence relative to
finding the arsenic in the bottle of chlorate of potass, we thought
it was possible there might be some mistake, and we made other
experiments to satisfy ourselves. We made seventy-seven experiments
with the same kind of gauze, and in seventy-six no
arsenic was discovered: and the only instance in which it was
found was in the evacuation in bottle 2.” The witness also said
that he could not, after hearing the symptoms and the treatment
of the deceased, attribute the death to any other cause than the
administration of some irritant poison.</p>

<p class="p1">This witness was also cross-examined at considerable length
as to the symptoms of slow poisoning by arsenic and by antimony,
in which he agreed with the previous witnesses, adding
to their evidence the fact of its operation in causing enlargement
of the liver, and the deposit of fat in it. Hence the use
of sulphide of antimony to fatten the geese used in Strasburg,
in the manufacture of Perigord Pies. On the subject of
dysentery he could not speak, having ceased to practise as a
medical man, and confined his attention to analyses.</p>

<p>On <i>re-examination, Dr. Taylor</i> said that “the half grain of
copper, given in the pill during life, would not by any action
of any acid in the stomach account for the quantity of arsenic
found in the evacuation; that he had examined and found no
arsenic in the copper pills; and that though arsenic was found
in the sulphate of copper taken from the surgery, there was
not a quantity to be seen; there was no arsenic in the bismuth,
and no antimony in the medicines. Arsenic is sometimes
found in bismuth.”</p>

<p><i>Dr. Odling</i>, Professor of Practical Chemistry at Guy’s
Hospital, who had assisted Dr. Taylor in his experiments,
2ì”confirmed Dr. Taylor’s account in every respect, and expressed
himself satisfied that there was antimony in the body of the
deceased. He agreed also in attributing the death to the
administration of some irritant poison, and did not know any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
natural disease that would account for the symptoms spoken
of.”</p>

<p><i>William Thomas Brande</i>, formerly Professor of Chemistry
to the Royal Institution, and for fifty years engaged in the
practice of chemistry, “had examined a portion of the liquid
(the chlorate of potass), and come to the conclusion that it did
not contain arsenic. Reinsch’s test for arsenic was reliable
where chlorate of potass was not present.” “Our first object,”
said the witness, on cross-examination, “was to get rid of
the chlorate of potass, or to decompose it so as to render it
inert, which we did; and we then examined the liquid in
question, and found no arsenic in it.”</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>To the Court.</i>&mdash;“I was not aware that Reinsch’s test would be
inapplicable to such a compound, and if I had applied it, and the
result appeared as it did to Drs. Taylor and Odling, I should have
come to the same conclusion, that there was arsenic in the substance.
<i>The matter that has appeared since is to a certain extent new to the
chemical world. We have always been aware of the presence of very
minute quantities of arsenic in copper, but we have never considered
it as interfering in any way until this particular case.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>It will be convenient, as in the previous trials, to report
at this period the medical and analytical evidence offered
on the part of the prisoner, subsequent to the address of
Serjeant Parry. This was devoted to the following points:
(1), the absence of some of the well-known symptoms in slow
poisoning by arsenic or antimony, or by both; (2), the similarity
of the symptoms in this case to those exhibited in cases
of acute dysentery; (3), the occurrence of severe diarrhœa,
with vomiting in the <i>early</i> stages of pregnancy; (4), that the
non-discovery of either arsenic or antimony in the tissues of
the body could not be due to its being given in, or with chlorate
of potass; (5), the probability that both the arsenic and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
antimony found in the evacuations and intestines might be due
to the presence of arsenic in the bismuth, and of antimony in
the grey powders administered as medicines. In support of
these opinions four doctors and analysts, all belonging to
what was known as the Grosvenor School of Medicine, were
examined, two of whom (Dr. Richardson and Mr. Rodgers) had
given evidence for Palmer at his trial, Dr. Richardson then
suggesting that Cook’s symptoms were reconcileable with an
attack of <i>Angina pectoris</i>, and Mr. Rodgers supporting the
view that if strychnia had been given to Cook, it must have
been discovered in his body by chemical analysis.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richardson</i>, after generally asserting that the symptoms
in Miss Bankes’ case were not in the main reconcileable
with either slow arsenical or antimonial poisoning, or both,
enumerated the following as absent if it was a case of slow
antimonial and arsenical poisoning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“1st, the inflammation of the conjunctival membrane of the
eye; 2nd, soreness of the inner surface of the nostril; 3rd, a skin
disease peculiar to arsenical poisoning; 4th, excoriation, amounting
to absolute destruction, possibly, of the surface at the orifice of the
mucous tracts, the mouth, the anus, the lips, and the vagina&mdash;and,
lastly, and, in his opinion, the most important, the absence
of the peculiar nervous symptoms which he should expect to find
which characterise arsenical poisoning&mdash;frequent convulsions of a
violent kind, in many cases; or in others, where the symptoms
may be prolonged, tremor of the whole limbs, a suppressed convulsion
in fact. <i>Although he should not expect to find all these symptoms
in a case of arsenical poisoning, he believed it to be quite impossible
that a case of arsenical poisoning could exist from which they would
all be absent.</i>&mdash;The results of the <i>post-mortem</i>” he said, “were
inconsistent with arsenical poisoning, because the inflammation
that would establish it was most demonstrated in the part ordinarily
most free in such poisoning&mdash;that, had it been a case of
arsenical poisoning, arsenic must have been found in the tissues,
and, had it been given in chlorate of potass, the whole of it would
not have been eliminated. He based this opinion on an experiment
he had lately made on a large dog, to which in sixteen days he
had given 18 grains of arsenic and 365 of chlorate of potass, in
small doses, two or three times a day, and then killed and examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and chemically analysed in conjunction with Dr. Thudichum and
Dr. Webb, two of the witnesses for the defence. In this animal
he found arsenic in the liver, lungs, and heart, a trace in the spleen
and in the kidneys, but the greater part in the liver. He could
venture to say that he found half a grain.”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“<i>Give me leave to say, that the value of this experiment
is nothing if you give a dog arsenic day by day for sixteen days,
and then it is killed, and some arsenic is found left in it; is that all
it proves?</i>”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“<i>No; it was done to prove whether the chlorate would
eliminate the arsenic as fast as it was given.</i>”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“<i>All that the experiment proves is, that chlorate of
potass does not eliminate the whole of the arsenic, because it eliminated
all but half a grain.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The witness then went on to show, by experiments on two
other dogs, that the administration of chlorate made no
difference either as regards symptoms, pathology, or the
chemical result. Speaking again of the sweating as one of
the symptoms in antimonial poisoning absent in Miss Bankes’
case, <i>he admitted that he had seen it only in one case, and
that, where it had been given in excess, for a long time, and
in large doses medicinally, and that in two other cases of acute
poisoning by antimony there was no particular eruption, because,
as he said, the attack was not long enough</i>. Such was
all the experience he had had in cases of slow poisoning. As
to the effects of antimony on the liver, he could only speak
from some experiments on animals in 1856-7, and that, in
reality, he had no experience at all in slow poisoning, except
from experiments on animals. Of dysentery, too, he knew
very little; had seen two or three cases, <i>but had never met
with it in the early stage of pregnancy; he had met with one
between the third and fourth month, but not between the fifth
and seventh week</i>. He had analysed the bismuth usually
administered in medicine, and had found nearly half a grain
of arsenic in an ounce, and, in a case in which 90 grains of
that drug had been given at the rate of 5 grains three times a
day&mdash;for dyspepsia&mdash;with Drs. Thudichum and Webb he
found about the fiftieth of a grain of arsenic in the urine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness was mainly occupied
by questions about his evidence on Palmer’s trial, and in
trying to elicit from him that these canine experiments had
been made for the purposes of the present case. The latter
he denied, but admitted that he had made them after reading
the examinations before the magistrate and the coroner, and
that though he did not communicate them to the prisoner, he
talked about them so frequently to his colleagues at the
Grosvenor School, that he was not surprised at being interviewed
by the prisoner’s solicitor and asked to give evidence
for his client. As to his evidence on Palmer’s trial, he maintained
that he did not endorse the theory that Cook died of
<i>Angina pectoris</i>; that he did not negative the idea of strychnia,
but at last admitted that he could not deny that he went
there to support the theory of <i>Angina pectoris</i>.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In the cases
of the dogs his analysis was not quantitative: he was content
with the fact that the arsenic was present. He negatived the
idea that the ¼ of a grain of copper in the pill would produce
a burning sensation from the mouth to the anus, <i>but admitted
that any irritant given for a long time would unquestionably
produce that effect</i>. The form of dysentery to which a lady
with such a liver as Miss Bankes’ would be subject, would be
subacute, not that arising from poison, but which is prolonged
over a very considerable time: not chronic, but something
between chronic and acute, but too severe to be strictly
chronic; that would not harden the coats of the stomach;
would produce a great deal of mischief in the bowels; would
not thicken them, but probably lead to a deposit of false membrane:
it would not harden them, but a false membrane
would; if there was great congestion, the wall would be
thicker. He had not acted as an accoucheur since 1854, but
was of opinion that sickness accompanied by dysenteric
diarrhœa, in the early stage of pregnancy, might have been
the cause of all the appearances exhibited in this case.
Diarrhœa was sometimes an incident of and caused by pregnancy;
the opposite effect, constipation, was not more usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>On <i>re-examination</i>, the witness qualified his admission as
to the effect of the copper pill to this extent, that, “in a
patient suffering from violent irritation, arising either from a
natural or mechanical cause, sulphate of copper would have a
tendency to increase that irritation; and he justified his reliance
on the experiments on animals on their forming the
great bulk of scientific knowledge in Europe on the subject of
poisons and their operation on the human frame, and by the
fact that the materials for forming a judgment of the effects
of slow antimonial poisoning on the human subject were very
bare,” and concluded by saying, that, “after his cross-examination,
and his attention having been called to all the points
deemed important, he still adhered to his opinion that the
deceased lady might have died from natural causes.”</p>

<p><i>Dr. J. E. D. Rodgers</i>, Professor of Chemistry in Knowle
College, but for seventeen years at the Grosvenor School,
agreed with Dr. Richardson that chlorate of potass would
have no effect in eliminating arsenic or antimony from the
human system; that the absence of arsenic or antimony from
the tissues, and especially from the liver, would cause him to
doubt whether the allegation of poisoning was correct, and that
he did not think it possible to find it in the blood and not
in the liver, “as the blood in the heart must be regarded as a
sample of the whole 28 lbs. circulating in the system, and, if
you find the poison in one small portion, you must find it
wherever the blood flows.” He confirmed the amount of
arsenic said to be in bismuth, and had found antimony in
grey powder: should expect to find, in a case of slow poisoning,
the symptoms spoken to by Dr. Richardson, and, if he
did not find any arsenic in a body from which an evacuation
containing one-sixth of a grain came, it would lead him to
doubt whether the experiment had been correct.</p>

<p><i>Dr. J. L. W. Thudichum</i>, Lecturer on Chemistry at the
Grosvenor School, and a pupil of Liebig’s, attributed the
death to what he called <i>diphtheritic dysentery</i>, of which he had
seen two cases, and, on opening the body in one case, found
the false membrane from which the disease takes its name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
The only medical work in which he had seen this form of dysentery
described was <i>Rokitansky’s Morbid Anatomy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> It was
not, however, at all necessary to find the false membrane, as it
might be broken up and discharged, and hearing that shreddy
matters were found in the evacuations, would confirm his
view. He quite concurred with the previous witnesses as to
the symptoms they would expect to find in a case of slow
arsenical or antimonial poisoning. He had analysed grey
powder and bismuth. In the former he found caustic and carbonate
of lime, mercury partly oxidised, silica, with phosphate
of iron, arsenic and antimony&mdash;more arsenic than antimony;
in the bismuth he found both arsenic and antimony&mdash;more
than a trace&mdash;enough to answer the test two or three times&mdash;an
appreciable quantity. “I dare say,” he said, “there
was half a grain in 20 grains. It is almost necessary, from
the mode of its preparation, that it should contain arsenic.”</p>

<p>On <i>cross-examination</i>, the witness admitted that he had
not made any quantitative analysis, because they were so
laborious; had used in his experiment about one-sixteenth of
2 ounces of the grey powder, which he dissolved; neither the
grey powder nor the bismuth had anything to do with the death
of Miss Bankes, but the fact of bismuth containing arsenic
might account for the traces in the evacuation, and if antimony
was taken in a medicine it might account for the analysis,
but this would depend upon the quantity in the medicine.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Cornelius Webb</i>, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence
and Toxicology at the Grosvenor School, and Physician to the
Great Northern Hospital, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“From all he had heard deposed to in court he was of opinion
that the deceased died from natural causes that might be accounted
for&mdash;that the fact of her being in an early state of pregnancy ought
most decidedly to be taken into consideration; <i>though he did not
know of a case, he was of opinion, founded on practical experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
and general knowledge, that severe vomiting and severe diarrhœa
which would not yield to ordinary treatment may arise from an early
state of pregnancy&mdash;that Miss Bankes died from dysentery, made
worse by the condition of early pregnancy, and that a burning sensation
in the mouth is consequent upon dysentery, and the diarrhœa
and vomiting of pregnancy. All the symptoms in her case might arise
from the vomiting and diarrhœa of pregnancy</i>. The ulceration in
the stomach, obliteration and partial destruction of the mucous
membrane, the effusion of blood under it, and the dark patchy
spots and ulcers and injection generally of the membrane might,
as Dr. Wilkes said, arise from dysentery. If the deceased at one
time had an affection of the womb, for which she used nitrate of
silver (a pint bottle of this was found in her room), it would
indicate ulceration of the neck of the womb; and if there had been
such a condition of the womb an appreciable time before pregnancy,
it might add to the irritation of pregnancy. Unless he found
other symptoms, the vomiting, diarrhœa, sensation of the throat
and the intestinal canal, accompanied by ulcerous appearances in
parts of the body, would not, in his judgment, necessarily lead to
the conclusion that she must be the subject of irritant poisoning&mdash;unless
he found other symptoms, it would not enter his head. In
a case of antimonial poisoning he should expect to find a clamminess
and cold perspiration of the skin. In arsenical poisoning he should
expect to find arsenic in the kidneys and the spleen, as well as the
liver; should expect to find it in the liver first&mdash;it is the great
criterion. And from the absence of these symptoms and appearances
in this case, he was fortified in his opinion that she died
from natural causes.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of this witness was mainly directed
to his assertion that, “in such a case as this, had he been
called in at its early stage, notwithstanding he was told that
she was not pregnant, and that her courses were in order, he
should have examined the patient for pregnancy, especially if
he found that the remedies were useless in stopping the
vomiting and diarrhœa.”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Dysentery,” he said, “was a most common disease, and in such
a state as Miss Bankes was, the quarter-of-a-grain copper pill might
increase the irritation. Diphtheritic dysentery was a form of
idiopathic dysentery, that is, occurring without any particular
poison&mdash;the Eastern form; there is a dysentery that arises from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
natural poison, just the same as fever. If I had been acquainted
with all the symptoms I have heard described in court, I should
not have dreamt of poison.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. G. F. Girdwood</i>, who had delivered upwards of 3,000
women, strongly supported the view of the death being due to
the effects of dysentery, combined with pregnancy. “Idiopathic
dysentery would be its proper name&mdash;a special disease
originating in itself, one single malady, one single suffering.
He had had several cases of dysentery at early stages of pregnancy,
one of them very severe, in fact, contemporaneous
with it&mdash;he should say symptomatic of pregnancy: this
would be much aggravated by a bilious temperament, and
any affection of the liver.”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> the witness explained that “in this country
idiopathic dysentery assumed a less severe form than in warm
climates&mdash;was what is called subacute or chronic, and that the
state of the cæcum indicated a case of <i>subacute, not of severe
dysentery, of prolonged dysentery</i>, and that it did not necessarily
follow that such a case should commence with febrile symptoms.”
On re-examination he stated, that “in early pregnancy the dysenteric
motions have become bloody, the sign of dysentery which
may come on immediately or not; in a day or two in acute
dysentery, the result of neglected diarrhœa. <i>Subacute dysentery</i>
is frequently the result of neglected diarrhœa, or chronic dysentery&mdash;you
have acute, subacute, and chronic.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. James Edmunds</i>, Surgeon to the Royal Maternity
Charity, cited a case in his own practice of a woman of about
forty years of age, who had been married ten or twelve years,
and who in her pregnancy suffered from vomiting, purging,
and severe pain in her abdomen, and who, from the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination which he made, he was convinced died of
dysentery, complicated by vomiting and irritability of the
stomach attributable to pregnancy, and purging attributable
to dysentery. “Purging,” he said, “was often a symptom
at an early stage of pregnancy, and often of impending
labour.”</p>

<p>On <i>cross-examination</i>, however, he admitted that when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
first attended this woman, <i>when the symptoms first began, she
had been pregnant five or six months</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Tyler Smith</i>, the last medical witness called for the
defence, in practice for fifteen years as an accoucheur, said
that</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He was acquainted with cases in which excessive vomiting in
pregnancy had caused death&mdash;where it went on after pregnancy
had commenced, sometimes during the whole period, but these
were exceptional cases. It would require considerable skill to
determine accurately the age of a fœtus, as you may have a case
in which it may die and remain <i>in utero</i> without development,
though no decomposition takes place. He had known one case in
which there was a great amount of vomiting and some amount of
purging, in which the friends of the lady could not be brought to
believe that her husband was not poisoning her. These symptoms
might become so violent as to be mistaken for a case of poisoning;
the expression on the face in such cases was that of death by
starvation.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, he admitted that though he had seen
cases of death in pregnancy from vomiting conjoined with
purging, he believed the vomiting to be the great cause of
death, and that ordinarily, if dysentery is excessive, abortion
is produced. On <i>re-examination</i>, he said “that in the case
of a woman of from forty to forty-five years of age, doses of
irritant poison were more likely to procure abortion than
idiopathic disease.” To a question by a juryman, he said,
“any irritating medicine would tend to keep up dysentery.”</p>

<p>With the evidence of a dentist (Pedley) who had attended
the prisoner about the middle of February last, and recommended
the use of chlorate of potass for foulness of breath,
the evidence for the defence was closed.</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p><i>The Lord Chief Baron</i>, in his address to the jury, which
occupied eight hours and a half, and of which, therefore, only
the leading points can be given, said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“As to the marriage of the prisoner and the deceased&mdash;though
in itself a breach of the law and a felony&mdash;the jury ought not to
allow it to have any weight, excepting so far as it operated, with
the other facts in the case, upon the question whether the prisoner
was guilty or innocent of the more serious crime laid to his charge.
It appeared to him that it was a most important subject for their
consideration&mdash;the position of the deceased at the time the fatal
event occurred, and also what she believed to be her position with
the prisoner. In the letter she wrote to her sister she stated she
was happy, and she also told her sister when she first saw her
during her illness, that when she got well all would be right.
What did she mean by that expression, and what would have
become of the prisoner if she had got well, he having a wife living?
In the will that had been made by the deceased, she appeared to
have been studiously called ‘spinster,’ and she signed her name,
‘Isabella Bankes,’ and how she could have done this, knowing that
she had gone through the ceremony of marriage with the prisoner,
and might, therefore, naturally have supposed herself entitled to
the name of ‘Smethurst,’ was certainly a very mysterious and
extraordinary circumstance.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> He could not help observing on
the circumstances under which the will was made. The prisoner
had certainly told Mr. Senior a falsehood, and he did not appear to
scruple to degrade most seriously the unhappy lady for the purpose
of having the will prepared in the form he required. If he had told
the attorney the truth, he would never have drawn the will in the
form in which it appeared. Again, at the very period when this
unhappy woman was lying in agony on her death-bed, and according
to the prisoner’s statement unable to bear the excitement of seeing
her sister, he took into her room on the Sunday an entire stranger,
and there a will prepared by himself was read to her, and executed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
by her under the circumstances of degradation to which he had
alluded. Thus this poor dying woman, from whom all her relations
had been excluded, had a stranger thrust into her presence, and
was allowed to pass into the other world without one word of
religious consolation, as if she had been a beggar and an unbeliever
in a heathen land. Again, as to the pecuniary motive, on the
supposed inadequacy of which counsel had commented because she
would have been entitled to receive the interest of the £5000
(£150) only during her lifetime, it should not be forgotten that by
her will he would be at once in the possession of a sum equal to
twelve years’ purchase of that dividend.”</p>

<p>“The illness of the deceased appeared to have commenced very
soon after the parties arrived at Richmond; the prisoner appeared
to have described it as a bilious attack; he undoubtedly appeared
desirous to have additional medical aid, and Dr. Julius was in
consequence called in. In both the lodgings he appeared to have
performed all the offices that were necessary in connection with
the patient, although it was perfectly clear that he had ample
means for providing the necessary attendance. The jury would
consider what bearing this had on the case. Did he refuse to
have a nurse because he did not wish to have a witness in that
bedroom? He not only refused to have a nurse, but he wrote to
the deceased’s sister to prevent her from visiting her sister. He
said that he could not afford a nurse, yet at this very time the
deceased had an income of at least £220 a year. It also appeared
that no portion of any of the food given to the deceased was
allowed to remain; it was always thrown away, so that no person
ever had an opportunity of tasting it. This was one of the facts
of the case, from which the jury would draw their own inference.
It was a fact in favour of the prisoner that neither arsenic nor
antimony was found at his lodgings or on his person. He had,
however, ample opportunity between his discharge on the Monday
and his re-arrest on the following day, of getting rid of any poison,
and if the jury thought that the deceased really died of poison, the
fact that none was found in the prisoner’s possession would not
have much weight.</p>

<p>“After the first interview, the prisoner had taken every means
in his power to prevent the deceased from seeing her sister, on the
ground that the doctor forbade it<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>&mdash;which was not true. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
was not the sister informed on the 30th, when she was allowed to
see the deceased again, that she had made a will, and what could
be the object of the prisoner in wishing that the young woman
who was to witness the will should be told it was a ‘Chancery
paper’ and not a will? The fact of the sister having been sent
away on the day before the death, was probably more in connection
with the will, and from fear lest the deceased should, at the last
moment, revoke it in favour of a beloved sister, than with the
actual death&mdash;but it was a fact in the case. It was also a fact in
the case, that after the prisoner ceased to attend on the deceased
she ceased to vomit, and that the prisoner said that as the parties
about the deceased had interfered, he should take no further
responsibility, nor pay for anything, though at that time he had
money of the deceased’s at his bankers.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> It was another fact to
be considered that the draft of the will was entirely in the
prisoner’s handwriting, and that there was no evidence that it was
drawn by a barrister as he represented.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On the medical testimony, the <i>Chief Baron</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The medical witnesses called for the defence thought the
symptoms of this case inconsistent with slow poisoning, and that
had arsenic or antimony been the cause of death, some portions of
those substances would have been found in the body.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> These
statements were, however, the opinions of scientific men, the result
of reading and study, and the jury would have to consider how far
it weighed against the evidence of those scientific witnesses who
had seen the patient when living, and had observed personally all
the symptoms that manifested themselves. The medical men first
called in found themselves baffled by the disease; the medicines
not only did not alleviate the symptoms, but did not produce even
their natural effects. They, therefore, came to the conclusion that
something was being administered which counteracted their medicines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Dr. Todd, one of the most eminent physicians of the day,
was called in, and came to the same conclusion. These gentlemen,
and other competent witnesses, who had not seen the patient while
living, were equally of opinion that the symptoms were not
ascribable to any natural causes; but were those which would arise
from the administration of an irritant poison. The counsel for the
prisoner had laid much stress upon the mistake made by Dr. Taylor
in one of his tests, and asked them to dismiss Dr. Taylor’s evidence
from their consideration. He did not agree with this. The
failure of Dr. Taylor’s analysis in one instance arose from a new
and hitherto unknown fact in science, and did not in any way
invalidate his testimony.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> It appeared to him that no answer had
been given to the main point urged by the prosecution&mdash;that no
medicine whatever had the slightest effect upon the malady under
which the deceased was suffering. <i>He did not agree with the
prisoner’s counsel, that the real question for the jury was to consider
which set of medical witnesses were entitled to credit. The medical
evidence was important, but the jury must, in addition, look at all
the other facts of the case, and particularly to the conduct of the
prisoner and the motives for his crime.</i> They must, after all, be
guided by those rules of common sense that would operate on the
minds of reasonable men with regard to the more important actions
of their lives; <i>and even supposing that there were no medical
testimony at all in the case, they would still have, as it appeared to
him, a very grave question to decide with reference to the guilt or
innocence of the prisoner</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">The jury, after deliberating for twenty minutes, returned
a verdict of “Guilty.” When the prisoner, who appeared
thunder-struck at the verdict, was called upon to say why
sentence of death should not be passed on him, he speedily
recovered his self-possession, and addressed the Court in a
powerful, though rambling speech, in which he attempted to
explain away some portions of his conduct, strongly asserted
his innocence, and denounced Dr. Julius, against whom he
appeared to entertain a bitter animosity. Again, when the
usual sentence had been passed upon him, which he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
without emotion, he denounced Dr. Julius as his murderer,
and declared that “he was innocent before God.”</p>

<p>No sooner was the verdict given than its correctness was
questioned alike by the legal and the medical profession, each
discussing it within its own domain, the doctors confining
themselves too exclusively to the conflict of medical testimony,
the lawyers confining their disputes too exclusively to
the collateral facts of the case. Such, however, was the discussion
between the two professions, that the Home Secretary
(Sir G. Cornewall Lewis) deemed it advisable to reprieve
the culprit until the case had undergone deliberate revision.</p>

<p>By the account given by Mr. Justice Stephen, based on the
notes and papers of the late Lord Chief Baron, it would appear
that, in addition to the numerous letters (some very foolish on
both sides) sent to him, and transmitted by him to the Home
Secretary, two communications, described as “somewhat
hastily prepared,” were forwarded from <i>Dr. Baly</i> and <i>Dr.
Jenner</i>. These urged that “sufficient weight had not been
given to the fact of the pregnancy and the ambiguous character
of the symptoms,” and, some of the letters added,
“their inconsistency and incompatibility with poison.” As
the reasons on which these “somewhat hastily prepared communications”
were based are not divulged, it is impossible to
judge of their value. The learned Judge, on the contrary,
called the Home Secretary’s attention to the statement in the
memorial to the Prince Consort (already quoted, note, p. 474),
to certain entries in Smethurst’s diary, not proved at the trial,
and not now given, showing that he had wilfully misstated the
symptoms of the patient, and to a statement in a letter of
<i>Mr. Herapath</i> in the <i>Times</i> that the quantity of arsenic
extracted from the chlorate of potass was larger than could
have been released from the copper gauze. (See Chapter
IX. p. 509.) On receiving this report the Home Secretary
referred the whole of the documents, together with the copy
of the evidence, to Sir B. Brodie. His reply, which, it is
reported, dealt not only with the medical, but the moral evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
of Smethurst’s guilt,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> concluded in these words:
“Taking into consideration all that I have stated, I own that
the impression on my mind is that there is not absolute and
complete evidence of Smethurst’s guilt.” Thus on evidence
not subjected to the searching cross-examination which it
could have received if produced at the trial, and the opinion
of a most eminent surgeon (not an analyst) merely on reading
the papers submitted to him, the prisoner was pardoned.
“The responsibility,” says Judge Stephen, “was thus shifted
from those on whom it properly rested on to a man, who,
however skilful and learned as a surgeon, was neither juryman
nor judge.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p class="pch">THE LIVERPOOL POISONING CASE.</p>

<p class="pc">TRIAL OF THOMAS WINSLOW FOR THE WILFUL MURDER
OF ANN JAMES.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><i>Before</i> <span class="smcap">Baron Martin, Northern Circuit, Liverpool</span>, <i>August 20, 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>For the Prosecution</i>: The Attorney-General for the County Palatine (Mr.
Bliss, Q.C.), Mr. Aspinall, <i>and</i> Mr. Temple.</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>For the Defence</i>: Mr. Digby Seymour, Q.C. for the County Palatine, Mr.
Fenwick, <i>and</i> Mr. Little.</p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p>The prisoner, who had been an ironworker, was charged with
the murder of Ann James, by aggravating the disease of the
<i>cæcum</i>, under which she was suffering, through the administration
of minute doses of antimony. Mrs. James came to Liverpool
from Devonshire, in 1854, whither she was soon followed
by her sister Eliza, her sister’s husband a Mr. Townsend,
an invalid, three nephews, and a niece, who was married to
a japanner of the name of Cafferata. Commencing business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
as a grocer, she had subsequently kept an eating-house, which
was eventually turned into a night refreshment and registered
lodging-house, of which the prisoner, one of her lodgers, had
taken the active management. Between him and the Townsends
it was evident that no good feeling existed. They were
jealous of his influence over their aunt, and suspicious of the
intimate relations that existed between them. One of the
nephews, Martin, who had caused her much trouble and
expense from frequently enlisting in and having to be bought
out of the army, acted as baker to the shop, but, with that
exception, the Townsends had no share in the business.
Previous to the last illness of their aunt, her sister, lately
left a widow, and the other two nephews, died suddenly, as it
was found afterwards, under very suspicious circumstances.
No investigation, however, was made in their cases, until
after the aunt’s death.</p>

<p>Mrs. James had prospered in her business: according to
her own account, the prisoner had made it. Her stock-in-trade
and the goodwill were worth between £200 and £300:
she had four gas shares, valued at £200, and £130 in the
savings bank, at the time of her death. An authority for the
withdrawal of the money from the savings bank, the holograph
of the prisoner, was found in a drawer, and during her
last illness the prisoner had gone to the gas company to try
and get the shares entered in his own name, and been told
that it could not be done without a proper transfer, or by will.
On this he got the solicitor of the gas company to see Mrs.
James and draw her will. This the solicitor did, no one but
himself and his clerk being present, and by it the business
and stock-in-trade were left to the prisoner, and the rest of
the property divided equally between Mrs. Cafferata and her
child, and the nephew Martin, the prisoner being appointed
sole executor. On the 5th of February, Mrs. James was so
ill that the prisoner called in Dr. Cameron, Physician to the
Liverpool Southern Hospital, who found her in bed, suffering
from bowel complaint, and a tumour in the abdomen, which
he believed to be cancer, and very weak and prostrate. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
prescribed for her, and desired to be sent for again if she
became worse. On the 26th of that month the prisoner wrote
to Mrs. Cafferata at Manchester to come at once if she wished
to see her aunt alive. She came and stayed with her for a
fortnight, sleeping in the same bed, in the back parlour, of
which the prisoner had the key at night. During Mrs.
James’s illness her food was prepared by her servants, and
brought to her room generally at night by the prisoner, who
was very attentive, and showed great interest in her condition.
On the 29th of March, Dr. Cameron was sent for again, and
found her symptoms similar to those he had seen on his first
visit. Again, on the 8th of May he saw her, when she was
suffering under a violent attack of purging and vomiting, but,
as regarded these effects, was convalescent by the 19th. On
the 25th, however, he found her again very ill, and for the
first time, from the symptoms, suspected that some foreign
ingredient, some irritating substance, such as antimony, had
been given to her. Mrs. Cafferata had again been sent for to
attend on her aunt. Dr. Cameron prescribed tannin as an
antidote, and on the 6th of June Mrs. James was again convalescent.
Two days after, however, the same bad symptoms
reappeared, and she became exceedingly prostrate. Some of
her urine and excretions were obtained and handed to Dr.
Edwards for analysis, and its results communicated to Dr.
Cameron, who, in consequence, went to her house on the
10th of June with the police, took possession of all the medicine
bottles and some cups that were in her room, and had
Mrs. James taken to the Southern Hospital. More specimens
of the excretions were obtained, and instructions given that
for the future they should be, from time to time, preserved.
On the evening of the 9th of June, if Mrs. Cafferata was to
be believed, a most suspicious incident occurred. “On that
evening,” she said, “I made my aunt a cup of sago from a
parcel on the kitchen shelf, which she took, and at three
o’clock the next morning took up to her a cup of tea and an
egg, and, as she did not eat them, I placed them on a chair
by the bedside, went into bed to her, and slept till nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
o’clock, having locked the door, and placed the key under it.
When I awoke I found my aunt awake, and appearing to want
to go to sleep. I then saw two cups had been brought into
the room in the night” (the prisoner admitted that he
brought one) “and the cup gone from the bedside.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In one
of these cups was a little sago, in which antimony was
detected by chemical analysis. For some days after her
removal to the Hospital Mrs. James continued very ill, but
ceased to have attacks of vomiting and purging after the first
or second day. Afterwards, however, she improved in health
until the 22nd of June, when dangerous symptoms occurred,
and she died in two days.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p class="psh">MEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Cameron</i>, who attended the <i>post-mortem</i> examination
of the body of the deceased, gave the following description of
the appearances presented.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The body was greatly emaciated. The membrane of the gullet
presented a yellow appearance. At the entrance of the stomach
there were two patches of false membrane, but I could form no
opinion how they were caused. The stomach was distended, and
contained sixteen ounces of fluid. There were two small ulcers
communicating with the cancerous tumour, which might have been
caused by the administration of antimony or by disease. The
bowels had been perforated and their contents discharged into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
cavity of the abdomen, which was the immediate cause of death.
My opinion is, that antimony was administered within a very short
time of her admission into the hospital&mdash;sometime between the 9th
and 10th of June. I do not think antimony was given to her after
her admission into the hospital. The vomiting was not of the kind
ulcers would produce, but of a kind which might be produced by
an irritating substance such as antimony.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> by <i>Mr. Digby Seymour</i>, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Hot food in a case like that of Mrs. James might produce
vomiting, and always occasioned more or less pain with ulceration
of the stomach. There was no redness of the small intestines.
Vomiting was one of the principal symptoms of ulceration of the
stomach, as by tending to starve and weaken the patient it
produced emaciation and prostration. Purging was not a usual
symptom of an ulcerated stomach, but occurred with cancer in the
bowels. Witness agreed with Dr. Richards as to there being no
case in which slow antimonial poisoning was accompanied with
dysenteric evacuations. The alternation of constipation and
purging was one of the known symptoms of antimonial poisoning.
The intermitting condition of the patient was one of the reasons
which led him to the conclusion that she was the subject of poison.
Witness agreed with the opinion that in malignant diseases of the
stomach the symptoms remitted in a remarkable way so as to
excite a hope that recovery would take place; but the truce was
not very long; frightful disorganization was at length produced
and inevitable death at last. Softening of the brain had been
noticed in some cases of antimonial poisoning, but it was not a
frequent or even an ordinary indication. Antimonial poisoning
sometimes produced enlargement of the liver, but it did not in this
case. Aphthous ulcerations in the glands of the small intestines
are also symptoms of the presence of antimony&mdash;<i>there were none in
this case</i>. Eminent writers on <i>Materia Medica</i> and pathology assert
that some persons can tolerate the presence of poison in their bodies
without it having any effect upon them. It is also an accepted
truth among eminent scientific writers, that there are conditions
and circumstances of the human frame in which antimony may not
possess poisonous results.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i>, the <i>witness</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“This toleration of poison is common in certain cases of inflammation,
but it is my opinion that, in this case, the opposite to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
toleration has been established. Aphthous ulcerations are not
often observed in cases of poisoning by antimony. The absence of
these symptoms, combined with the state of the liver and brain, in
no way affect my opinion as to the poisoning in this case. There
were peculiar symptoms in the vomiting of Mrs. James which
induce me to believe that it was not caused by the ulcer. Antimony
would aggravate the ulcerous disease and enfeeble the bodily
powers, as well as affect the appetite. One of the effects of slow
poisoning by repeated doses is that the stomach is prevented from
receiving fresh nourishment.”</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>To the Judge.</i>&mdash;“I have never attended a human patient
poisoned by antimony. Persons suffering from sickness after food
are relieved by vomiting; but in the case of Mrs. James there
was considerable retching after the food was thrown off the
stomach.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>John Baker Edwards</i>, Analytical Chemist, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He analysed a bottle of urine which he received from Dr.
Cameron on the 6th of June, and informed him that he found in it
slight traces of antimony. On Saturday, June 9, he received two
bottles from Dr. Cameron, one of which contained fæces, analysed
it and found slight traces of antimony. The other bottle was
marked ‘vomit.’ Analysed that, and found in it two considerable
deposits of antimony. Subsequently confirmed this analysis by
other chemical tests. He sublimed it by the application of heat,
and obtained a white sublimate, which, when examined under the
microscope, had the appearance of oxide of antimony. Afterwards
dissolved this in tartaric acid, passed sulphuretted hydrogen gas
through it, and obtained an orange precipitate&mdash;sulphuret of
antimony. He could not scientifically distinguish whether it was
‘free’ or ‘eliminated’ antimony.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> On Wednesday, the 13th of
June, he received three bottles labelled ‘Mrs. James, Tuesday,’
one of which was labelled ‘vomit.’ It had scarcely a trace of
antimony. The other two bottles contained fæces and urine, in
each of which was a trace of antimony. On the same day he also
received two cups, one of them containing about a tablespoonful of
sago. This he analysed and found in it two considerable deposits
of antimony on copper, which he sublimed and recognised under
the microscope as oxide of antimony. On Thursday the 14th he
received three bottles, one of them of vomit, containing no antimony;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
the other two containing fæces and urine, in which was no
antimony. On the 15th he again received a bottle of vomit and
also one of fæces, and in the former he found two antimonial deposits,
which under the microscope he recognised as oxide of antimony,
and in the latter a trace of antimony. On the following
day he found traces of antimony in two bottles of urine. The day
after he received two bottles, one of urine, and found a trace of
antimony in each. He also examined some uncooked sago which
contained no antimony. Subsequently (after Mrs. James had been
removed to the hospital) he received bottles labelled ‘Mrs. James.’
The vomit contained no antimony, but there were still distinct
traces of it in the fæces and urine. He subsequently received four
jars containing brain, lungs, heart, spleen, kidneys, intestines,
stomach, and blood, labelled ‘Mrs. James,’ and four bottles containing
fluids. He analysed portions of these separately. From
one half of the stomach he obtained five deposits of antimony. He
also obtained five deposits of antimony from the intestines, four
deposits of it from one of the kidneys, and three deposits of it
from one half of the liver. He found no trace in the brain. In
four ounces of blood he found a distinct deposit of antimony, and
also from the fluid of the stomach. He also analysed six bottles
of medicine and two of urine, and found no antimony. On the
26th of July he took a portion of the spleen and lungs of Mrs.
James to London, and examined them there in conjunction with
Dr. Miller and Dr. Taylor, and also the deposits of the viscera.
He examined and tested them and found by the most approved
tests applied that they contained antimony.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, the <i>witness</i> admitted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That the first satisfactory result which he obtained was on the
9th of June&mdash;that he had no doubt that the trace he found on the
7th was antimony, but it was not a satisfactory result&mdash;that he
had examined the body of a dog which died from antimony, and
which had been exhumed, and had not found a trace, and, that if
the animal had vomited after taking it he should not have
expected to find any.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. A. S. Taylor</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That he received some jars at Guy’s Hospital from Inspector
Horne, containing portions of the stomach, cæcum, liver, one kidney,
and the heart, and afterwards from Dr. Edwards a portion of the
spleen and lungs. He divided them and gave a part to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Miller. Dr. Edwards showed him some sublimate on glass, and
deposits on copper. He examined them. The deposits on copper
were metallic antimony, and those on the glass were oxide of antimony.
He was of opinion that antimony had entered the body
during life. Assuming the deceased to have been labouring under
the disease of the cæcum, and to have had two ulcers in her
stomach, the administration to her of antimony, by depressing the
bodily powers, would tend to accelerate death. Antimony had a
powerful depressing influence and lowered the pulse in strength,
produced great exhaustion of the system, and in a serious disease
affecting the body was likely to aggravate its effects. A person
might be able to bear a dose of antimony in health, who in a
serious disease would be destroyed by it. His opinion, in this case,
was that antimony had been administered at intervals in small
doses. Antimony could be found in the tissues three weeks after it
was taken. It might during that time be found, day by day and
at intervals, in the secretions. The tests which he had applied
were the most approved known in science.”</p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, the <i>witness</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The disease which has been described as affecting the deceased
must have terminated fatally. The death had been caused by
inflammation arising from the passage of the contents of the
diseased bowel into the cavity of the abdomen. It was very difficult
to draw the line where a patient had rallied from the effects
of poison, and where she sank under disease. The medical man
in attendance on the deceased person would be the best judge of
the influence of poison in accelerating death. Small doses frequently
repeated would have the effect of irritating the mucous
membrane of the bowels. In two most marked cases of poisoning
with which he bad been connected there had been no change in the
condition of the liver. <i>All the indications in Mrs. James’s case were
referable to natural causes.</i> If antimony were found in the fæces,
he should conclude that the purging was occasioned by antimony.
In vomiting caused by ulcers in the stomach, it was confined to
the relief of the stomach from its contents, and then ceased.
Antimony produced prostration of the nervous power.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Dr. Miller</i>, Professor of Chemistry at King’s College, confirmed
the opinion of Dr. Taylor so far as it related to the
chemical analysis, but gave no medical opinion.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Clarence Pemberton</i>, House Surgeon at the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
Hospital in Liverpool, deposed that he attended Mrs. James
and paid attention to her symptoms. He made the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination. “Taking the symptoms observed during
lifetime, and the appearances shown by the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, and assuming the judgment of Dr. Edwards to
be correct, the cause of death, in his judgment, was the
diseased ‘cæcum,’ but the administration of antimony would
undoubtedly accelerate her death.”</p>

<p>On <i>cross-examination</i>, he admitted that, <i>judging from
what he saw in the hospital, all the symptoms might be attributed
to natural causes</i>, and, in answer to the Judge, said
that <i>on the post-mortem examination he could find no traces
or symptoms which he exclusively attributed to the administration
of antimony</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Francis Ayrton</i> said he saw the viscera and the other
portions of the deceased sent for analysation. He observed
some redness at the commencement of the small intestines,
and some spots on the large ones, and he formed his opinion
from these spots that an irritant had passed through the
bowels. Antimony was an irritant, and would produce such
appearances. He had heard the evidence given, and his
opinion was that the deceased’s death was accelerated by
antimony. He also admitted, on cross-examination, that
<i>what he observed in the viscera might be attributable to other
causes than antimonial poison</i>.</p>

<p class="psh">THE PRISONER’S STATEMENTS.</p>

<p>According to the evidence of Mrs. Cafferata, and the
inspector of police, the prisoner openly accused the Cafferatas
of having poisoned their aunt. He objected to their interference,
and ordered them to leave the house, calling
Cafferata a second Palmer, because he carried white powders
about in his pocket, and saying, when the wife showed
him the soda powders in question, “You are not likely
to show me the right stuff.” When Mrs. Cafferata wanted
to go to the hospital to see her aunt, he threatened to
put her under arrest. That the prisoner had a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
drink when he spoke in this way was admitted by the witness,
but when he made the same accusation of the Cafferatas to
the inspector such apparently was not his condition. On the
other hand, a Mrs. Higgins, on cross-examination, spoke to a
threat of Mrs. Cafferata’s that “she would hang the orange
dog (the prisoner), and that after her evidence they would
want no more.”</p>

<p class="psh">PURCHASE OF POISON BY THE PRISONER.</p>

<p>The proof of the purchase of antimony by the prisoner was
most unsatisfactory. A woman (Ann Foley) who used to
work for Mrs. James, remembered that during the previous
summer, on one occasion, when Mrs. James was sitting
behind the counter and the prisoner was present, she said to
him, “Here is Mrs. Foley; she will go for it;” that they
then gave her twopence and told her to go and get antimony
for the dog, and that when she went to a chemist of the name
of Miller for it he would not let her have it, but told her to
tell them to bring the dog over to him. This chemist’s
assistant (E. P. Rees) remembered a woman coming for antimony
some nine or ten months before, a second person coming
also for it on the same day, and a third about four months
after for the same drug, to poison a dog with. The third
person, he believed, but could not swear, was the prisoner.
Another witness (Eliza Brennan) told a strange story about
the prisoner. She had been in Mrs. James’s service, some
two years ago, and spoke to him about leaving and going to
Dublin in the first week of her service. On this the prisoner,
she said, advised her to stay, but added that, “if she would
go, if she would buy him half-a-crown’s worth of antimony in
Dublin, and send it to him by the boat, he would give her
£5.” Lastly, a newspaper boy (Thomas Maguire), who slept
at Mrs. James’s house, swore that</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The prisoner once sent him for a pennyworth of something for
the dog, he did not know its name, but what he got was a white
powder, which when given to the animal in water purged it violently&mdash;that
within half an hour the prisoner sent him again for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the same, and now told him its name was antimony. He got it,
said the witness, from a young man, name Coopland, at Miller’s
the chemist. He declared it was taken from a bottle six or seven
from the window, and professed to point out the bottle to the
Inspector of police. He knew that the letters ANT. on it stood
for antimony. He had also several times since January last seen
the prisoner when making bread and butter for the mistress take
from his pocket a white powder in a paper and throw some of it on
the bread before he buttered it; when he asked him once what it
was, the prisoner had said it was salt. When the witness said
‘there was salt enough in the house without that,’ the prisoner
made no reply.”</p>

<p class="p1">To Inspector Home the prisoner admitted that “he knew
the use of antimony, and had given it to cattle, but had not
had any in his possession for many years.”</p>

<p>In his charge to the jury, <i>Baron Martin</i> told them that, if
they believed that the prisoner administered the antimony with
the intention of killing, and that her death from a natural disease
was thus accelerated, that was murder&mdash;citing the dictum of
Lord Hale “that if a man be sick of some disease which
might possibly end his life, and another gave him a wound,
which would hasten his death, this was murder by the party
giving the wound”&mdash;they were to guard against prejudice
because of the nature of the crime, and not to convict unless
the evidence affirmatively satisfied their minds of his guilt.</p>

<p>The jury almost immediately returned a verdict of “Not
Guilty.”</p>

<p class="psh">ANTIMONY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> metal antimony (symbol Sb, from its classical name
<i>Stibium</i>) is heavier than arsenic (sp. gr. 6·8), less easily
tarnished, more difficult to pulverize, and not nearly so volatile.
It forms somewhat brittle masses, with a fern-like
crystalline appearance on the surface. When broken the
interior shows radiating (rhombohedral) crystals of a bluish-white,
strongly metallic lustre (arsenicum is greyish, bismuth
is pinkish, white), yielding a grey or black powder. Melting
point, 425° C. Heated with the blowpipe on charcoal it gives
white fumes of oxide, <i>without odour</i> (arsenic gives a garlic
odour). The metal is insoluble in water and dilute acids, but
soluble in <i>aqua regia</i> to form antimonious chloride; also
soluble in sulphide of potassium or sodium. Hot concent.
sulphuric acid converts it into sulphate. Nitric acid turns
it into a white powder consisting chiefly of <i>metantimonic acid</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>HSbO<sub>3</sub>, of which a small quantity dissolves.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The powdered
metal burns in chlorine, forming Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>, or Sb Cl<sub>5</sub>. Metallic
antimony is obtained as a “mirror” in Marsh’s test: the
distinctions between it and arsenic have been already given
(p. 389).</p>

<p>The following is the percentage of metallic antimony in
different alloys. English type metal, 20 to 25; German
ditto, 15; Britannia metal, 10 to 16; pewter, 7; Argentine,
14½; Ashbury metal, 19½; white or anti-friction metal for
engine-bearings, 10; Babbit’s metal, for similar purposes,
13; alloy for ships’ nails, 17 (Ure’s Dictionary, I., 169;
Roscoe and Schorlemmer’s Chemistry, 1880, ii., 2, p. 307).
There is also antimony in brass, metallic mirrors, bell-metal,
&amp;c. (Blyth). <i>Antimony black</i>, used for giving a steel-like
lustre to plaster casts, is finely divided Sb, precipitated from
the chloride by zinc.</p>

<p>Metallic antimony is not poisonous unless partially oxidized.
Commercial samples usually contain a little arsenic,
which enters into the salts.</p>

<p><i>Antimonious chloride</i>, Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>, when pure, forms colourless
glistening deliquescent crystals. A solution in hydrochloric
acid constitutes the commercial “butter of antimony” used
for giving a dark bronzing to brass. It is a thick, powerfully acid
liquid, coloured brown by the presence of iron, fuming in
air, very corrosive, and of an irritating odour, distilling over
at about 200° C. (<i>pure</i> Sb Cl<sub>3</sub> boils at 223° C.), decomposed by
water into a white magma of <i>oxychloride</i>, Sb O Cl, “powder of
Algaroth” (tartar emetic is not decomposed by water). It
is a violent corrosive poison, blackening and destroying the
surfaces like oil of vitriol. For cases, <i>see</i> Woodman and Tidy,
p. 130.</p>

<p><i>Antimonic chloride</i>, Sb Cl<sub>5</sub>, is rarely met with. It resembles
Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>, but is liquid.</p>

<p><i>Antimonious sulphide</i>, Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub>, is found native as “stibnite,”
“speiss-glas,” “grey antimony,” or “antimony glance,”
sp. gr. 4·63, in lead-grey striated prisms, fibrous or massive,
of a strong metallic lustre, fusing readily to a dark-brown
glass &mdash;“vitrum antimonii”), giving before the blowpipe white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
fumes, and an odour of sulphur dioxide &mdash;“brimstone”). It
is the principal ore, the source of all the preparations, and is
itself used in fireworks. When powdered it is black, and in
this state was used by the Roman ladies under the name of
“stibium,” by the Orientals as “Kohl,” for darkening the
eyelids. It is soluble in hot hydrochloric acid to form SbCl<sub>3</sub>.
The precipitated sulphide is orange, and will be noticed under
the tests. Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> would not be poisonous until oxidized.</p>

<p><i>Antimonious oxide</i>, Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, obtained by burning Sb in air,
is a white powder, turned yellow on heating, soluble in hydrochloric
acid to form Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>, and in cream of tartar (acid potass.
tartrate) to form <i>tartar emetic</i>. Unlike As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, it does not
easily volatilize in crystals. It is occasionally found native.</p>

<p><i>Antimonic oxide</i>, Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub>, is a pale yellow powder. There
is also an intermediate oxide, Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Antimonious and antimonic acids</i> are hydrates of the above
oxides. They exist in several modifications, and form metallic
salts, one of which, sodium pyrantimonate, Na<sub>2</sub> H<sub>2</sub> Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>7</sub>,
6 H<sub>2</sub> O, is the only known insoluble salt of sodium, and hence
available as a test.</p>

<p><i>Antimonious hydride</i>, Stibine, or “antimoniuretted hydrogen,”
Sb H<sub>3</sub>, has never been obtained pure. In admixture
with hydrogen, as given by Marsh’s test, it is a colourless
gas, almost or quite <i>inodorous</i> (distinction from As H<sub>3</sub> which
smells like garlic), decomposed by heat into hydrogen and a
“mirror” of Sb. Its poisonous properties have been doubted,
but it is probably more dangerous than As H<sub>3</sub>, on account of
the absence of the warning odour. It burns with a bluish-green
flame, giving white clouds of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, and a spot of Sb,
duller and greyer than As, when a cold porcelain surface is
depressed into the flame. Passed into silver nitrate solution,
the Sb is precipitated along with metallic silver as <i>silver antimonide</i>,
Ag<sub>3</sub> Sb, whereas arsenic under the same circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>would remain in solution as As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="psh">TARTAR EMETIC.</p>

<p><i>Potassio-antimonyl tartrate</i>, <i>tartrate of antimony and
potash</i>, “<i>antimonium tartarizatum</i>,” “<i>tartarized antimony</i>,”
“<i>stibiated tartar</i>,” symbol K (Sb O) C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>4</sub> O<sub>6</sub>, ½ H<sub>2</sub> O, occurs
in colourless rhombic octahedral crystals, transparent at first,
but becoming opaque by efflorescence, or as a white powder,
inodorous, and with a strong metallic taste. The aqueous
solution is faintly acid to test-paper, and becomes mouldy on
keeping. When evaporated on a glass slide, it leaves a
crystalline residue of <i>tetrahedra</i>, cubes and branching forms.
(<i>See</i> figure in Guy and Ferrier’s For. Med., p. 469.) Heated
on platinum, tartar emetic blackens and swells up with an
odour of burnt sugar (due to the tartaric acid), gives a bluish-green
tint to the flame, and quickly fuses and makes a hole in
the platinum, from the formation of a fusible alloy. Heated
in a closed tube, it gives charcoal, potass. carbonate, and
metallic antimony, which does not sublime at a moderate
temperature, is inodorous, and may be separated in metallic
globules by washing (differences from arsenic; <i>see</i> p. 389).
Sulph. hydrogen of course gives the orange-red sulphide.</p>

<p><i>Solubility.</i>&mdash;Tartar emetic is almost insoluble in alcohol,
and still less soluble in ether, chloroform, &amp;c. Spirits and
water, such as are mixed for drinking, dissolve nearly as much
as cold water, and more if warm. The solubility in cold
water is given very variously in the text-books, from 1 part in
21·8 &mdash;“20 grains per fluid ounce,” British Pharmacopœia),
1 in 20 (Garrod and Blyth), 1 in 15 (Brande’s and Gmelin’s
Chemistry), to 1 in 14 (Graham and Taylor). To clear up
this difficulty I prepared for Dr. Bernays in 1879 a very pure
sample of the salt: he found that 100 cubic centimetres of
water at 58° F. dissolved 6·67 grammes, equal to <i>one part in
fifteen</i>. The solubility rises rapidly with the temperature,
till it reaches <i>one part in two</i> at the boiling point. The discrepancies
are accounted for by the facts that, (1), the textbooks
do not mention the temperature; (2), the salt readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
effloresces in air, losing water and becoming less soluble;
(3), impurities are often present.</p>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;Commercial tartar emetic is generally very
pure. It sometimes contains a trace of sand and dirt, occasionally
an excess of cream of tartar (potass. hydrogen tartrate)
from careless preparation, but I have never found
arsenic. The theoretical percentage of Sb is 36·53: in good
commercial samples Bernays found 36·03 to 36·32 per cent.;
in an over-dried specimen, 37·4 per cent. One sample contained
23 per cent. of cream of tartar and only 28·13 of Sb;
another, 10 per cent. tartar and 32·7 of Sb.</p>

<p class="psh">USES AND OCCURRENCE.</p>

<p>The alloys and pyrotechnic uses have been already mentioned.
The impure fused sulphide (vitrum antimonii) is
employed to give a yellow tint to glass and porcelain. The
oxides are used in glazing earthenware, and in glass and
china painting. The following are antimonial pigments:
“Antimony cinnabar,” and “crocus,” or “saffron of antimony,”
are oxysulphides: “Naples,” “Cassell,” and “antimony
yellows,” are chiefly antimoniates of lead. Small
quantities of antimony occur in iron ores, ferruginous waters,
the coal formation, and in river sand (Roscoe).</p>

<p>In <i>veterinary practice</i>, large doses of antimonials are given
to animals, as much as 90 grains of tartar emetic being often
administered to a horse in his gruel three times a day. Other
preparations are used (<i>see</i> Blyth’s Pract. Chem. 1879, p. 404).
They are supposed to cause fattening.</p>

<p><i>Medicinally</i> it is employed in typhus, <i>delirium tremens</i>,
small doses in croup and the broncho-pneumonia of children,
as a general expectorant in asthma and bronchitis, in whooping-cough,
by some recommended also in scaly skin affections.
In acute inflammations and pneumonia, it has lost favour, as
too depressing (Farquharson’s Therapeutics). In times
before chloroform, tartar emetic was even used to lower the
muscular tension previous to reducing dislocations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">DOSES AND PREPARATIONS.</p>

<p><i>Pulvis antimonialis</i>, 3 to 10 grains. This is the Pharmacopœial
equivalent of “James’s Powder,” a secret remedy
once highly popular. It contains one part of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> to two of
phosphate of lime.</p>

<p><i>Vinum antimoniale</i>, antimonial wine, is a solution of
10 grains of tartar emetic to each ounce of sherry: dose,
5 minims to 1 fluid drachm.</p>

<p><i>Antimonii oxidum</i>, Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, is often very impure. It may
contain, (1), higher oxides of Sb, when it is not completely
soluble on boiling with water and cream of tartar; (2), carbonate
of lime, when it effervesces with acids and contains
less Sb; (3), traces of arsenic, when it gives a garlic odour
before the blowpipe on charcoal. Percentage of Sb, 83·56:
dose, 1 to 4 grains.</p>

<p><i>Antimonium sulphuratum</i>, or <i>oxysulphuretum</i>, is precipitated
Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> with a small amount of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>. It contains
about 62 to 65 per cent. Sb (pure Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> has 70·2 per cent.).
Dose, 1 to 5 grains, but rarely prescribed, except in “compound
calomel pill,” <i>pil. hydrarg. subchlorid. co.</i>, which contains
20 per cent. of Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Antimonii chloridi liquor</i>, a solution of Sb Cl<sub>3</sub> in hydrochloric
acid, is sometimes used as a caustic, never internally.</p>

<p><i>Antimonium tartaratum</i>, tartar emetic: dose, as a diaphoretic,
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> to ⅙ grain; as a depressant, ⅙ to 1 grain; as an
emetic, 1 to 2 grains (to 3 grains, Farquharson). It should
never be used as an emetic in suspected poisoning, as its
presence would confuse the investigation.</p>

<p><i>Unguentum antimonii tartarati</i>, antimonial ointment, contains
20 per cent. of tartar emetic.</p>

<p>The following proprietary pills contain tartar emetic in the
annexed proportion per pill weighing about 3 grains:&mdash;<i>Dr. J.
Johnson’s</i>, 0·04 grain; <i>Mitchell’s</i>, 0·05 grain: <i>Dixon’s</i>,
0·06 grain (Blyth).</p>

<p>It has been stated that the liqueur <i>absinthe</i> owes its deleterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
effects to antimony. I have tested several specimens,
but never found antimony, though traces of lead or copper
were occasionally present.</p>

<p><i>Fatal dose.</i>&mdash;About this, nothing can be exactly stated.
The smallest was, in a child, ¾ grain; in an adult, 2 grains;
but in this instance there were circumstances which favoured
the fatal operation (Taylor, Med. Jur. i., 310).</p>

<p>If vomiting and purging happen, the poison is for the most
part expelled: except for the effects of exhaustion, there may
then be hardly a limit to the amount which may pass in and
pass out. Taylor records recoveries from 120 grains, 200
grains, and even <i>half an ounce</i> of tartar emetic. In pneumonia
it has been given in repeated doses of 2 grains without
ill effects. It must be remembered that, in the hands of the
poisoner, its perverted use is, not to kill, but to so weaken
the vital powers that a small and not suspicious dose of some
other poison may complete the death.</p>

<p><i>Fatal period.</i>&mdash;Shortest, seven hours in an adult female
(Wormley); eight hours in a boy after 10 grains tartar
emetic (Lancet, 1846, p. 460). Usually much longer: four
days after 40 grains (Orfila, i., 480); up to one year from
after effects (Guy and Ferrier).</p>

<p class="psh">PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.</p>

<p>The unpleasant metallic taste, the heat in the throat, and
burning in the stomach, have been described in the previously
reported trials, and in other cases. Afterwards there is
nausea, severe vomiting, profuse watery purging, often convulsions
which are sometimes tetanic in character; the skin
is generally cold and clammy with perspiration; there is
collapse from exhaustion, and occasionally delirium and insensibility.
Death may happen either during the convulsions,
or during the collapse. The heat and constriction in the
throat is not invariably present.</p>

<p>After death there is generally found inflammation of the
stomach and intestines, especially the cæcum: the brain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
sometimes congested, the throat rarely affected. The stomach-contents
are usually tinged with blood, as with most irritant
poisons.</p>

<p>In smaller doses it acts at first as a sedative on the brain;
the action of the heart becomes slower, weaker, and finally
irregular, the pulse is soft, the breathing slower; there is an
increased bronchial secretion, and general muscular relaxation.
As an emetic it is sluggish and depressing, and is often
followed by diarrhœa. It powerfully promotes perspiration,
and is therefore used in influenza, &amp;c. Poisonous doses may
cause paralysis, prostration, degeneration of the liver and
other organs (<i>see</i> Taylor’s remark about the geese at Strasburg,
p. 464), inflammation and even ulceration of the intestines
(Farquharson and others).</p>

<p class="psh">ANTIDOTES.</p>

<p>Sometimes vomiting does not occur: in this case it should
be promoted by tickling the throat, and by draughts of warm
water. <i>Tannin</i> precipitates compounds of antimonious oxide
(Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>), but not those of antimonic oxide (Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub>): as the
former are the ones almost invariably used, astringent preparations,
such as strong tea, coffee, decoction of oak bark, galls,
tincture of catechu or kino, should be given. Tannin, or
tannic acid, is commonly kept by photographers. Failing
this, sodium carbonate (washing soda), in not too strong
solution, may do good. Opium to allay the irritation, and
brandy to overcome the depression, should then be tried.</p>

<p class="psh">SEPARATION AND TESTS.</p>

<p>During life, antimony may be found in the urine and fæces:
after death, if its administration has been long continued, it
will be found in all parts of the body, but especially in the
<i>liver and spleen</i>. If the doses have been discontinued some
time before death, none may be left in the stomach and intestines.</p>

<p>The enquiry divides itself into three parts: 1st, the <i>presence</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
of antimony; 2nd, the preparation used; 3rd, the
quantity.</p>

<p class="psh">I. <span class="smcap">Presence of Antimony.</span></p>

<p>Marsh’s and Reinsch’s tests have been mentioned under
arsenic. It, however, will be necessary to add a few observations
on their special use for Sb.</p>

<p>A fractional part, say one-fourth, of the suspected matter,
after mincing or pounding, is digested with hot distilled water
containing 5 per cent. of <i>pure</i> hydrochloric, and a little tartaric,
acids, well shaken or stirred in a covered or closed vessel,
and after some hours filtered. To a portion of the filtrate is
added a little more hydrochloric and a little sulphuric acid
(to reduce the higher oxides of As and Sb), and the whole is
boiled for ten minutes. A portion of the filtrate is now subjected
to</p>

<p><i>Reinsch’s Test.</i>&mdash;First it is absolutely necessary to have
<i>pure copper</i>; so pure, in fact, that a quantity, <i>larger than
would be used in testing</i>, will not, <i>if totally dissolved up</i>, yield
any As or Sb to another piece of copper boiled in the solution.</p>

<p>Dr. Taylor’s mistake in the case of Smethurst, more fully
treated of hereafter, was a very natural one. The trace of
arsenic in his copper would not have affected the conclusion
in ordinary cases: but it would be better not to test at all
than to use materials which are not <i>proved beforehand</i> to be
free from the poison we are seeking. Pure “electrotype”
copper can now be purchased; or it can be made pure by
either of the following methods.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Pure” commercial sulphate of copper is boiled with
a slight excess of chlorine water, then treated with dilute
ammonia till a slight permanent precipitate forms: after
standing twelve hours it is filtered (the precipitate containing
iron and arsenic), acidulated with <i>pure</i> sulphuric acid,
and subjected to the current from two Daniell cells, the terminals
being two plates of hard wax well coated with purified
graphite: the coating must communicate with the copperwire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
from the battery, and the wire must not dip into the
solution. The distance between the terminals should be so
regulated that the copper may be deposited <i>slowly</i> and in a
tough layer on the negative pole: the thin plate so obtained
may afterwards be easily detached, hammered or rolled, and
cut into suitable pieces: it is absolutely free from arsenic.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Pure crystallized chloride of copper is mixed with pure
carbonate of soda in excess, the mixture dried with constant
stirring, heated to near redness, powdered, mixed with an
equal volume of lamp-black, and introduced into a “plumbago”
crucible lined with a paste of purified graphite and
oil. The crucible is covered, and gradually heated in a
Fletcher’s or Griffin’s gas furnace (not with coal or coke), and
finally kept at a very high temperature till the copper is reduced.
The fumes contain chlorides of copper, sodium, &amp;c.,
and are poisonous. The copper, after separation from the
slag, may be cast, hammered, or rolled, and is free from As
or Sb.</p>

<p>I suggest these processes more for manufacturers than for
chemists, but expense and trouble should really be subordinate
considerations where life is concerned.</p>

<p>Now for the application. Two flasks containing pure diluted
(25 per cent.) hydrochloric acid are placed on a sandbath,
and nearly closed by small glass funnels. About a
square inch of pure copper, cleaned by sand-paper, is placed
in each: to one is added the suspected liquid, to the other
an equal bulk of 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid. Both are
boiled, with occasional inspection. If the following are present,
the copper will be darkened:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Arsenic.</i>&mdash;Stain <i>steel-grey</i>: dried and heated in closed tube
it gives <i>easily</i> a sublimate of octahedral crystals of As<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>.
(<i>See</i> Arsenic, <i>ante</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Antimony.</i>&mdash;Stain black, or in small quantity, <i>violet</i>: in
the closed tube it gives with difficulty an <i>amorphous</i> white
sublimate of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, soluble in H Cl, and then precipitated
<i>orange</i> by H<sub>2</sub> S.</p>

<p><i>Mercury.</i>&mdash;Stain silvery: in closed tube gives a sublimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
of <i>metallic globules</i>, made more visible by rubbing them together
with a splinter of wood.</p>

<p><i>Bismuth</i>, <i>tin</i>, <i>silver</i>, <i>gold</i>, <i>platinum</i>, <i>palladium</i>, &amp;c., give
black, grey or silvery deposits, but no <i>sublimate</i> in the tube.
<i>Gold</i> gives a stain which is <i>yellow</i> on burnishing, and yields
no sublimate.</p>

<p><i>Sulphur compounds</i> in the organic matter may give a dull
stain, which may even yield a kind of sublimate in the tube,
but this sublimate will not conform to the tests for As or Sb.</p>

<p>If there is much As or Sb, the deposit sometimes peels off
if boiled too long.</p>

<p>The process used by Prof. Maclagan in the Pritchard trial
is also a good means of verification. Boil the stained foil in
a solution of caustic potash, exposing it occasionally to the
air (or boil with a weak, slightly alkaline solution of potass,
permanganate, and filter&mdash;Odling). The Sb will be oxidized
and dissolved. Add HCl and pass H<sub>2</sub> S: an orange precipitate
of Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> will prove the presence of antimony.</p>

<p>If Sb has been found, remove the first piece of copper, and
boil with another piece, and so on till the Sb is all removed.
The coated slips, the sublimate, the Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub>, and the copper in
the second flask which has still remained bright, should be
sealed up to be shown in court.</p>

<p>The previous treatment with sulphurous acid prevents any
interference by oxidizing agents such as chlorate of potash,
nitrates, iodine, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Marsh’s Test</i> is more delicate, but more liable to error,
than Reinsch’s.</p>

<p>Two methods of applying Marsh’s test to antimony may be used.</p>

<p>A. By Edmund Davy’s process with sodium amalgam (<i>see</i>
Arsenic, p. 388), only As H<sub>3</sub> passes off, the Sb remaining behind.
Hence, when the arsenic has finished coming over, if the remaining
solution be acidulated with <i>pure</i> sulphuric acid,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> <i>pure</i>
zinc put in, and one or two drops of <i>pure</i> platinic chloride added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
to facilitate the evolution of hydrogen, the antimony will then
come over as Sb H<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>B. Or the original substance may be placed in the flask,
treated at once with the zinc and dilute acid, and the As H<sub>3</sub>
and Sb H<sub>3</sub> passed together into silver nitrate solution, and
separated by filtration as directed under arsenic. <i>See</i> p. 389,
also as to the distinctions between the stains of Sb and As.
To these add, that metallic spots of both As and Sb are
soluble in yellow ammonium sulphide: the solutions on
evaporation to dryness on the water-bath give:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>). With <i>arsenic</i> a <i>yellow</i> stain, soluble in ammonia,
insoluble in hydrochloric acid;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>). With <i>antimony</i> an <i>orange</i> stain, insoluble in ammonia,
soluble in hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><i>Metallic antimony</i> can be precipitated as a black powder
from its solutions by acidulating with hydrochloric acid and
treating with a slip of pure tin, which does not precipitate
arsenic. Zinc or electrolysis also precipitate Sb, along with
copper and many other metals. Hence this method is not
available in mixtures.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuretted hydrogen</i> gives with antimonial solutions
slightly acidulated an orange-red precipitate of sulphide,
insoluble in ammonia or ammonium carbonate, soluble in
ammonium sulphide, soluble in hot strong hydrochloric acid by
conversion into antimonious chloride, and sulphuretted hydrogen:
the former then gives a white precipitate with water, the
latter gives the characteristic odour and blackens lead paper.</p>

<p>The reactions with sodium hydrate and sodium carbonate,
are not so clear or decisive. Potass. ferrocyanide gives no
precipitate. Tannin and tincture of galls give a yellowish
white precipitate. Before the blowpipe with sodium carbonate
on charcoal, solid Sb compounds give a grey brittle globule of
the metal and a white incrustation. But there is rarely
sufficient for such a test to be of use in toxicological work,
there is also a risk of loss, and other metals give a similar
reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;<i>Among other substances, sulphide of antimony is
frequently added to caoutchouc in the process of vulcanising
india-rubber: in all toxicological experiments involving tests
for antimony (and arsenic), great danger of a mistake is thus
attendant on the use of ordinary vulcanised india-rubber
tubing. Black unvulcanised tubing should alone be employed.</i></p>

<p class="psh">II. <span class="smcap">Preparation Used.</span></p>

<p>The insoluble compounds would act very slowly as poisons
and would require very large doses, hence would be found in
the solid form in the stomach, and could be identified by
appearance, by the microscope, and by the tests, after
washing and settling down.</p>

<p>To ascertain whether antimony was <i>in solution</i>, the liquid
contents of the stomach, after dilution with water if necessary,
should be allowed to settle, the nearly clear top layer decanted
and filtered, and the filtrate examined. The soluble compounds
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Tartar emetic.</i> Solution <i>slightly acid</i>, taste metallic.
On evaporation on a glass slide <i>tetrahedral crystals</i> are
obtained. If the solution is moderately strong, it gives a
white precipitate with a little hydrochloric acid, soluble in
excess: with water it gives <i>no precipitate</i>. Stomach generally
inflamed but not corroded.</p>

<p>2. <i>Antimonious chloride</i>, Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>. Solution <i>strongly acid</i>,
effervescing and giving a white precipitate with sodium
carbonate. Taste corrosive and powerfully metallic. On
evaporation, no tetrahedra. No precipitate with hydrochloric
acid: with water a white precipitate, re-dissolved by tartaric
acid.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> By analysis a large quantity of <i>chlorine</i> will be
found. The stomach is corroded and often blackened or
charred.</p>

<p>3. <i>Antimonates</i>, <i>antimonites</i>, <i>sulphantimonites</i>, and <i>-ates</i>
(such as “Schlippe’s salt”), are rare and improbable. Antimonates
are <i>alkaline</i>, give a white precipitate with acids, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
a white crystalline one with sodium salts. Schlippe’s salt is
strongly alkaline, and gives with hydrochloric acid an orange-red
precipitate of sulphide.</p>

<p class="psh">III. <span class="smcap">Quantity.</span></p>

<p>To ascertain the amount of Sb is absolutely necessary.
Marsh’s test is not available, since a large part of the
antimony is thrown down on the zinc and remains in the
generating flask. It has been proposed to wash this off and
weigh it, but other metals and impurities are present, so that
this is not practicable. Reinsch’s test has been applied
quantitatively by weighing the copper before and after the
test: the difference of weight was supposed to be the As or
Sb. But the copper may dissolve or oxidise, sulphur and
other things deposit on it; so that this method is not correct.</p>

<p>If antimony only is present, acidulate with hydrochloric
acid, pass sulph. hydrogen in excess, warm, filter, wash
the orange hydrated antimonious sulphide into a porcelain
capsule, remove most of the water, dry on the water bath,
finally at 200°C. and weigh. 100 grains of Sb<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> correspond
to 85·88 of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>, to 196·47 of tartar emetic, to 71·76 of
Sb, to 134·41 of Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>But in the stomach any other metal may be present, hence
a process of separation must be used. It is not generally
necessary to destroy the organic matter: if this be desired,
Fresenius and v. Babo’s process, of heating with H Cl and
potass. chlorate (previously proved pure) may be used without
much danger of loss, as Sb Cl<sub>3</sub> is not so volatile as As Cl<sub>3</sub>.
Otherwise the solution made by pure hydrochloric and a
little tartaric acids is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen.
The precipitated sulphide may be of uncertain, though suspicious
colour. After collection on a filter and washing, it
should be extracted with dilute ammon. carbonate solution
(10 per cent.): <i>arsenic</i> only will dissolve and will be reprecipitated
as sulphide on adding an acid. The remainder
on the filter must be treated with freshly prepared ammon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
sulphide: <i>antimony</i> and <i>tin</i> will dissolve. If any black
residue remains on the filter, it will consist of <i>mercury</i>, <i>lead</i>,
<i>bismuth</i>, or <i>copper</i>: it should be treated with hot 25 per cent.
nitric acid, when all will dissolve except <i>mercuric sulphide</i>.
We shall then have three portions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The <i>mercuric sulphide</i>. Wash, dry, and weigh.
Then heat in a sealed tube with dry sodium carbonate,
collect the sublimate of metallic mercury, weigh it, and
preserve in a sealed tube.</p>

<p>2nd. The nitric acid solution containing <i>lead</i>, <i>bismuth</i>, and
<i>copper</i>. Evaporate nearly to dryness, dilute, add dilute
sulphuric acid, and a little alcohol, after standing collect and
weigh the precipitated sulphate of <i>lead</i>. Precipitate the
<i>bismuth</i> by ammon. carbonate in excess, and the <i>copper</i> from
the filtrate by zinc or by sulph. hydrogen. (<i>See</i> Fresenius’
Quant. Anal. p. 411).</p>

<p>3rd. The ammon. sulphide solution of the <i>antimony</i> and
<i>tin</i>. Evaporate to dryness, dissolve in hot strong hydrochloric
acid, dilute, divide into two equal portions: in <i>one</i>
throw down both metals by a rod of <i>zinc</i>: in the other
throw down only Sb by a slip of <i>tin</i>. Wash off both precipitates,
dry and weigh. The first is antimony and tin
together, the second is antimony alone (Gay Lussac). The
difference is the tin.</p>

<p>Usually only <i>some</i> of these metals will be present. <i>Tin</i>
has derived more importance lately since Hehner has proved
its almost constant presence in canned provisions.</p>

<p>As to the delicacy of the precipitation of antimony by zinc
or galvanism, Mohr (Toxicologie, 1876) states that a solution
containing ·00005 gramme of Sb in one cub. centimetre gives
a distinct reaction in fifteen minutes. Such a solution gives
with H<sub>2</sub>S only a colouration, and after a long time a faint precipitate.
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>30000</sub> part gives with zinc a clear reaction in one half-hour:
with H<sub>2</sub> S, only a colour, no precipitate, in twelve hours.
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>40000</sub>, doubtful: <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50000</sub>, imperceptible with zinc: of course,
nothing with H<sub>2</sub> S. The reaction is only decisive if other
metals are excluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>From the solution of Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>, or tartar emetic in H Cl, <i>gallic
acid</i> throws down Sb, and not As or tin. The precipitate
after washing and drying contains 40·85 per cent. of Sb.
(Chem. News, XXIV. 207, 251.)</p>

<p>To sum up, the decisive characters of antimony are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. An orange red precip. by H<sub>2</sub> S in slightly acid solutions.</p>

<p>2. The insolubility of this precip. in ammon. carbonate.</p>

<p>3. Its solubility in ammonium sulphide.</p>

<p>4. Its solubility in hot H Cl, with evolution of H<sub>2</sub> S, and
formation of a solution of Sb Cl<sub>3</sub>, which is precipitated by
water and cleared up again by tartaric acid.</p>


<p class="psh"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span><br />
DR. PRITCHARD’S CASE.</p>

<p>In connection with the supposed administration of tartar
emetic on a piece of cheese, in Dr. Pritchard’s trial (<i>see</i> Mr.
Clark’s review of McCleod’s evidence, p. 438), the following
considerations are of interest.</p>

<p>1. An exceedingly small (weighed) quantity of dry powdered
tartar emetic was sprinkled on the surface of a little piece of
cheese: although the amount of tartar emetic used was far
less than that required to induce vomiting, &amp;c., the powder
was found to be plainly visible, and the appearance of the
cheese so treated would certainly have excited suspicion in
the mind of any ordinarily observant person. Hence it is impossible
that enough tartar emetic to produce the recorded
effects should have been sprinkled externally on the very
small amounts of cheese described &mdash;“not larger than a bean”&mdash;M.
McCleod: “size of a good large pea”&mdash;M. Patterson).<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>2. With reference to the Lord Justice Clerk’s observation,
p. 439, <i>note</i>, tartar emetic is <i>not</i> easily dissolved, a cold
saturated aqueous solution containing only 5 per cent. of the
salt (according to the B. P., 20 grains dissolve without residue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
in 1 ounce of water). A piece of cheese, the size of a
bean, would weigh about ⅛ ounce. I have found by experiment
that 1 ounce cheese took up by soaking not more
than ¼ ounce water, which, from the above, could contain in
solution 5 grains of tartar emetic. Hence a piece of cheese,
the size of a bean, = ¼ × ⅛ = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub> ounce water = ⅝ grain of
tartar emetic. This amount could not cause the symptoms
described.</p>

<p>3. If put on in powder the poisonous salt could only be
concealed by being rubbed over with butter or oil: if soaked
in a solution of tartar emetic, the cheese, in order to avert
suspicion, must be wiped or dried&mdash;operations practically impossible
at the table with so many present.</p>

<p>Two possibilities remain: (<i>a</i>) Cheese is often eaten with
salt. Dr. Pritchard may have had a little salt-cellar by his
side, professedly for his own use, containing tartar emetic,
either alone or mixed with salt. He may have placed a
spoonful of this on the plate with the cheese: the latter may
have been either dipped into the salt or got into it accidentally.
No question was asked at the trial about such a likely
fact, which would account for one person suffering, and not
another, according as they got the salt or not. The strong
taste of salt would avert suspicion from that of tartar emetic.
(<i>b</i>) McCleod said that it was “new cheese&mdash;they had it in
the house&mdash;it was soft&mdash;it tasted hot like pepper.” It is
possible, but not easy, by warming and pounding in a mortar,
to mix cheese with a considerable amount of a powder: it
would then look <i>soft</i> and rather unnatural, but might, as
“new cheese,” escape suspicion. This theory is less probable
than the other.</p>

<p><i>Tapioca.</i>&mdash;Mr. Clark’s remark, p. 438, “Now the suggestion
of the Crown is that the prisoner put antimony in this
tapioca, so nicely adjusted as to produce sickness leading to
death, but not so as to produce death itself,” is inconclusive,
as it requires a considerable amount to produce <i>death</i>. A
large quantity of tartar emetic could be mixed with tapioca
without suspicion, and would not betray itself by any peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
appearance on cooking. The same remark applies to the
sago in Winslow’s case.</p>

<p><i>Egg-flip.</i>&mdash;“The amount of antimony introduced on the
sugar into the egg-flip must have been a very powerful dose,
because Patterson took only a teaspoonful and lay vomiting
and suffering all night.” The total amount was a tumblerful
(= 10 fluid ounces). Mrs. Pritchard took a wine-glassful
(= 2 fluid ounces); was sick very soon and all night. Mary
Patterson took a teaspoonful, was sick immediately, and
vomited frequently throughout the night. Her dose must
have been at least 1 grain. This would make 60 grains in
the whole. Such a quantity of tartar emetic would be about
a teaspoonful, and obviously could not be introduced on two
lumps of loaf sugar, as the following experiment shows:&mdash;Two
rather large pieces of loaf sugar weighing together
204 grains were gently shaken with powdered tartar emetic,
and the loose part shaken off. The lumps now looked rather
powdery, but nothing very noticeable. The amount of tartar
emetic they had taken up was nearly 3 grains (2·96), not
nearly a teaspoonful, though amply sufficient to cause vomiting.
It is not the <i>porosity</i>, but the roughness of surface,
that enables a powder to adhere to the sugar. The tartar
emetic might have been slipped into the egg-flip, out of the
hand, at the same time that the sugar was added, the mixture
being afterwards stirred up.</p>

<p class="psh">DR. SMETHURST’S CASE.<br />
<span class="smcap">Dr. Taylor and Mr. Herapath.</span></p>

<p>In his evidence before the committing magistrates, on the
20th of May, Dr. Taylor said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I found no arsenic or antimony in any of the bottles
delivered to me by Inspector McIntyre on the 5th and 7th of
May, except one, and the homœopathic medicine: that one
was bottle 21.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> When I received this bottle it was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
half full of thin, watery-looking mixture, and I tested it. It
had a cooling, pleasant saline taste, not repugnant, no smell.
I detected nothing wrong with the taste. I evaporated some
in a glass, and examined it by the microscope, and then found
it was not tartar emetic, as I thought. I then applied the
tests for arsenic, and every test I tried was destroyed, and
failed to show the existence of arsenic, owing, as I supposed,
to there being in it, and my tests convinced me that there
was, something very peculiar about it that I had not met
before. I tried Reinsch’s process, but I found that it dissolved
the copper-gauze as soon as I put it into the liquid. I
then determined to extract this noxious agent, and continued
to put in copper-gauze until it no longer possessed the power
to dissolve it. I then put in a piece of copper, which at once
received the arsenic. I was able to decide by these tests that
the mixture was chlorate of potash. I found there was of
chlorate of potash 7 grains to the ounce, or 1 and <sup>6</sup>/<sub>10ths</sub> per
cent., and there was a grain of arsenic to every ounce. I
found that the taste of the liquid in this bottle was such that
no one would be likely to suspect that it contained arsenic,
more particularly as the quantity of arsenic was so small that
the liquid could be mixed with any kind of food and swallowed
without the person being aware of it.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In the bottles brought
to me by Dr. Berry<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> I found arsenic&mdash;<i>that was white arsenic</i>.
I could not give an opinion on that in the evacuation (No. 2),
as that was mixed with blood and mucus. In No. 1 there
was biliary matter without any metallic substance.”</p>

<p>Subsequently to the conviction of Smethurst, Mr. Herapath
wrote the letter to the <i>Times</i>, on the 27th of August, before
referred to in the Lord Chief Baron’s communication to the
Home Secretary, in which, after a wordy and personal attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
on Dr. Taylor, with special reference to his having used for
twenty years untested copper, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“But was the arsenic said to have been found in bottle 21
really in the copper used to prove its presence? Could the
copper wire-gauze dissolved by 7 grains of chlorate of potash
and its associated hydrochloric acid deposit one grain of
arsenic? In the face of all England, I say it could not. The
100th part of a grain of arsenic in that quantity of copper
would render it so brittle that it could not be drawn into wire
at all, much less into fine wire fit for gauze. The fact is the
whole set of operations were a bungle. Reinsch’s process is
inapplicable where nitrates or chlorates are present. Taylor
must have known this: it was well known then that chlorates,
nitrates, arsenates, and other oxidizing agents, interfered with
Reinsch’s process. When Taylor found the copper dissolved&mdash;he
knew that one of these oxidizing agents was present&mdash;he
ought then to have either used Marsh’s test instead of
Reinsch’s, or should have prepared the solution by sulphurous
acid first. The method he did use was as dangerous as
could be.”</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Herapath communicated this opinion to the
friends of Smethurst before the trial, as he ought to have
done, does not appear. At any rate he was not called for the
defence, and his opinion was apparently only made public after
the conviction. It stands, therefore, like all the other communications
laid before the Home Secretary, untested by
cross-examination. How far was he correct?</p>

<p>Taylor does not state how much of the liquid in bottle 21
he took for analysis. Assuming that he took 1 ounce,
7 grains of chlorate would dissolve, <i>at the most</i>, 22 grains of
copper. If this yielded 1 grain of arsenic, the copper must
have contained 4½ per cent. of that poison&mdash;an impossible
quantity. Less than ½ per cent. of arsenic renders copper
brittle. So far Herapath was right.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>(2.) If Taylor was right that what he got was <i>white arsenic,
that could not have come from the copper, which can only
contain arsenicum&mdash;metallic arsenic</i>. Therefore if Taylor’s
analysis was not altogether wrong, <i>in bottle 21 there really
was arsenic, and the prisoner was proved to have had the
materials for poisoning in his possession</i>.</p>

<p>Taylor’s procedure in dissolving up piece after piece of
copper, which had not been previously proved, by the same
process, not to contain arsenic, was highly blameable, and his
assertion that he had previously tried his tests and found
them pure, was not strictly true. Altogether, his tests both
for arsenic and antimony were not reliable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="pch p4">ADDENDA.</p>

<p>The “bismuth” frequently referred to in the report of
Smethurst’s trial is the Bismuthi Subnitras, B. P., also
known by the various names of “Bismuthum Album,”
“White Bismuth,” “Trisnitrate of Bismuth,” “Subnitrate
of Bismuth,” “Magistery of Bismuth,” “Pearl White,” &amp;c.
This compound is a basic nitrate of bismuth, Bi N 0<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> 0:
it is insoluble in water, and is a heavy, white, minutely-crystalline
powder, much used in medicine, and also as a cosmetic.
The name “bismuth” is misleading as applied to
this drug, which is <i>not</i> bismuth, but a <i>salt</i> of that metal.</p>

<p>Ordinary subnitrate of bismuth frequently contains various
adulterations and impurities. The most usual adulterants
are carbonate of lead, carbonate of lime and phosphate of
lime (Royle’s Materia Medica, 1876): among the impurities
which have been found are ammonia (Piper, Pharm. Journ.,
Ap. 21, 1877), arsenic, lead, iron, chlorine, and sodium salts.
Some specimens of bismuth subnitrate analysed by Herapath
contained 1 grain of arsenic in 1000: others contained as
much as 1 grain in 433. Taylor, also, found arsenic in three
samples out of five examined by him. Riche (J. Pharm. et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
Chim., 5, 384) states that the majority of commercial samples
of bismuth subnitrate contain lead and arsenic, the former to
the extent of ·03-·04 per cent. (as sulphate), and the latter
(as arsenious acid) to ·002-·01 per cent., while Chas. Ekin
(Pharm Journ., 3, III., 381) remarks that this preparation of
bismuth is often very impure, containing much subchloride,
copper, and occasionally lead. On the other hand, three
specimens of subnitrate of bismuth, analysed by Bernays, contained
no arsenic, lead, or carbonic acid, while the percentage
of bismuth oxide present closely approximated to the theoretical
amount. Moreover, in the Practitioner, Mar. 1871,
p. 191, the results of the examination of six samples of bismuth
subnitrate are given, the only impurities found being
traces of chlorine and sulphuric acid: there was no arsenic.
<i>Hence it is evident that subnitrate of bismuth does not always
contain arsenic: and the quantity of this impurity, when present,
is so minute as (having regard to the small doses in which
the drug is usually prescribed in medicine) to be insufficient to
produce the graver symptoms of arsenical poisoning.</i><a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The presence of arsenic in bismuth subnitrate may easily
be detected by Marsh’s test.</p>

<p>Subnitrate of bismuth nearly always contains arsenic and
other impurities, when it has been prepared from commercial
bismuth. The British Pharmacopœia, therefore; very properly
directs that <i>purified</i> bismuth (Bismuthum Purificatum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
B. P.) should be used in the preparation of this drug: the
B. P. method of purifying the metal is as follows. 10
ounces of bismuth and 1 ounce of nitrate of potash are
fused together in a crucible, heated and stirred, until the salt
has solidified into a slag over the metal: the salt is now removed,
another ounce of nitrate of potash is added, and the
remainder of the process is repeated. The fused bismuth is
now poured into a mould, and allowed to cool.</p>

<p>Herapath states that the arsenic is not all removed by this
process, and he proposes to boil the nitrate in solution of a
caustic alkali, which removes the arsenic and converts the
bismuth into oxide, from which the salts can be prepared
(Royle).</p>

<p>From the purified metal subnitrate of bismuth can be prepared
by the following process, which is that given in the
British Pharmacopœia. 2 ounces of purified bismuth are
gradually added to a mixture of 4 fluid ounces nitric acid with
three ounces distilled water: when effervescence has ceased,
heat is applied for a few minutes, and the solution is decanted
from any insoluble residue. The liquid is concentrated by
evaporation to 2 fluid ounces, and poured into half a gallon
of distilled water. The precipitate formed (Bi N 0<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> 0) is
well washed by decantation, filtered, and finally dried at a
temperature not exceeding 150° F.</p>

<p>In the event of the bismuth used not having been thoroughly
purified, and being therefore still likely to contain a trace of
arsenic, a modification of the above process, recommended by
R. Schneider (Journ. Prakt. Chem., 1879, 418), may be
employed. It consists in <i>heating</i> the acid before the bismuth
is added, and continuing the heating until the metal is
dissolved. If arsenic be present, the solution will contain in
suspension a white precipitate of <i>bismuth arsenate</i>, which is
nearly insoluble in nitric acid, and can be removed by filtration
through asbestos, before the solution is diluted. Cold nitric
acid would convert any arsenic present into <i>bismuth arsenite</i>,
which is readily soluble in nitric acid, and could not, therefore,
be separated by filtration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Grey powder</i>” is Hydrargyrum cum Creta, B. P., and
consists of one part of metallic mercury in a very finely
divided state, mixed with two parts of chalk. It is made by
rubbing mercury and prepared chalk together until metallic
globules are no longer visible. The mercury in this preparation
always becomes in course of time more or less
oxidised, the amount of oxide formed varying according to the
length of time the mixture has been kept, and the extent of
its exposure to the air.</p>

<p>Iron, silica, and phosphoric acid, might be present in very
small quantities as impurities, in many samples of grey
powder: caustic lime could not possibly occur, unless the
specimen had been subjected to a red heat, which would drive
off the mercury and so spoil the preparation. Antimony and
arsenic would rarely be met with as impurities in grey powder,
and if present, would only be in very minute quantities.</p>

<p class="pch">POISONING BY ACONITIA OR ACONITINE. THE WIMBLEDON
POISONING CASE&mdash;DR. LAMSON.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> this head of poisons, there is only one trial to report
in full, that of Dr. Lamson for the murder of his brother-in-law,
Percy Malcolm John, at Wimbledon, on Saturday, the 3rd
of December, 1881, for which he was tried before Mr. Justice
Hawkins, at the Central Criminal Court, on the 8th of March,
1882, and the five following days. The especial difficulties
in the way of detecting this preparation of aconite, invested
the case with more than usual interest to both the medical
and legal profession. The subsequent attempt by the convict’s
friends to induce the Home Secretary to delay his execution,
in order that his mental condition might be inquired
into, backed as it was by the American Government, kept
alive the public interest to an unusual extent, and bid fair to
revive another such controversy as that which followed, but
with a different result, on the conviction of Smethurst. By
the kindness of Mr. W. A. Mills, Dr. Lamson’s solicitor, I
have had the advantage of reading the whole of the very
numerous affidavits tendered in support of this application, of
which I have given a summary at the close of the trial.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Though the trial now reported is the only one in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
aconitia was employed, other forms of aconite have been used
in previous cases. In that of Dr. Pritchard it was administered
in the form of tincture of aconite, and as far back as
1841, in the case of <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>McConkey</i>, it was administered
as powdered aconite root. In this case the reputed poisoner
was tried at the Lent Assizes, Monaghan, and the medico-legal
investigation was conducted by the late Dr. Geoghegan,
of Dublin. As in Pritchard’s and Lamson’s cases, the medical
evidence was beset with difficulties, for no trace of the
poison could be discovered in the body, and it was only by a
close analysis of symptoms and appearances that the charge
was brought home to the prisoner. The deceased had eaten
at his dinner some greens dressed for him by the prisoner:
he complained of their having a sharp taste, and this was perceived
also by another person present who tasted them. It
was ascertained that the deceased, soon after the meal, had
vomited a greenish matter, and suffered from purging, restlessness,
incoherence, lockjaw, and clenching of the hands.
He died in about three hours after having eaten the greens,
but was not seen by a medical man while living. The chief
appearance met with was in the stomach, where the mucous
membrane was of a light reddish-brown colour. Traces of
vegetable matter were found in the intestines, but no poison
could be detected, either botanically or chemically. The
symptoms suffered by a friend of the deceased, who had accidentally
tasted the greens, were very characteristic of poisoning
by aconite. In <i>two</i> minutes he felt a burning heat in the
mouth, throat, gullet, and stomach; then a sensation of
swelling in the face, with a general feeling of numbness and
creeping of the skin. Restlessness, dimness of sight, and
stupor almost amounting to insensibility, followed; and in
about an hour after the meal he was found speechless&mdash;frothing
at the nose and mouth, the hands and jaws clenched,
appearing occasionally as if dead, and then again reviving.
Vomiting, purging, tenderness at the pit of the stomach,
cramps, tingling of the flesh, and a burning taste in the
mouth, followed. This man did not entirely recover until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
after the lapse of five weeks. The prisoner was convicted,
and confessed before his execution that the powdered root
of Monkshood (aconite) had been mixed with pepper and
sprinkled over the greens.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p><i>George Henry Lamson</i>, surgeon, aged 29, was indicted for
the murder of his brother-in-law, Percy Malcolm John, at
Blenheim House, Wimbledon, on December 3rd, 1881.</p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1881, among the pupils at the school of
Mr. Bedbrook, of Blenheim House, Wimbledon, was Percy
Malcolm John, the youngest of the five children of a Manchester
merchant, a lad of about nineteen years of age, a sad
sufferer from paralysis of the lower limbs produced by curvature
of the spine, but otherwise in a fair state of health.
Since the death of their mother in 1869, the children had
been orphan wards in Chancery, and previously to 1881, one
brother and one sister had died, under age, another sister
had married a Mr. Chapman, and the third the prisoner, a
medical practitioner at Bournemouth, who was now indicted
for the murder of his brother-in-law. By the wills of their
parents, the children, as they came of age or married, were
entitled to the family property in equal shares, those of such
as died under age passing to the survivors. Hence, at the
time of his death, Percy John had property in expectance to
the amount of £3,000, which, in the event of his death as a
minor, would be equally divided between his two married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
sisters, and by the settlement made by Mrs. Lamson on
her marriage, her share would come into the hands of the
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Though such a sad sufferer from paralysis as to
be unable to move about readily except in a wheel-chair, and
only able to drag himself backwards up a few stairs,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> there
were no symptoms of serious bodily illness in the lad: his
temper was good, and his intelligence fair.</p>

<p>In his brother-in-law’s health Lamson appeared to take
great interest, visiting him at the school, having him to stay
at his own house, and sending to his master from America
some medicines which he stated had been found useful in
that country in similar cases. On the 1st of December, the
prisoner wrote to the boy that he would come to see him the
next evening, before he left for Paris&mdash;a promise which he
failed to keep.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> On the 3rd, however, about seven in the
evening, he came, bringing with him some sweets, a cake,
and a box containing gelatine capsules, which he told the
master he had brought for him from America, as convenient
for enabling him to administer nauseous medicines to his
pupils. At this interview with his brother-in-law, he persuaded
Mr. Bedbrook, who was present, to take one of these
capsules to try how easily they were swallowed. Whilst
doing so, the master noticed that the prisoner was filling
another with some powdered sugar, which he had asked for,
on the plea of destroying the alcohol in some wine of which
he was partaking. When he had put in the sugar, the
prisoner, turning to the lad, shook up the capsule, saying,
“It has to be shaken in order that the medicine may go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
the bottom. You are good at taking medicine; take this.”
The boy swallowed the capsule, and within a few minutes
after, the prisoner, saying that he wanted to catch the tidal-train
for Paris, left the school-house. In about twenty
minutes afterwards Percy complained of heartburn, gradually
became worse, was carried up to bed, and vomited largely in
the closet.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> “He felt,” he said, “as he had done in the previous
August when the prisoner gave him a pill in the Isle of
Wight.” He was in great pain, violently restless, and with
difficulty kept down by those who were holding him. After
more simple remedies had failed to relieve him, the doctors
who had been called in injected morphia under the skin, which
had a temporary effect. This was subsequently repeated, but
with no apparent result, and shortly afterwards he died, within
four hours of swallowing the capsule. The <i>post-mortem</i> examination
revealed no signs of such a natural form of disease
as would account for his sudden death&mdash;the only sign of
disease being the long-standing curvature of the spine, distressing,
but at that time innocuous. A chemical analysis of
the stomach and other parts of the body was had, and, so far
as the present state of scientific knowledge could decide, it
was the firm opinion of the experienced analysts Drs. Stevenson
and Dupré, that death was due to an irritant vegetable
poison, and that that poison was aconitia, a most highly
poisonous vegetable alkaloid, containing the active principle
of aconite, the product of the root of monkshood.</p>

<p>Suspicion naturally fell on the prisoner, and was greatly
increased when it was discovered that a few days before his
last visit to the boy he had purchased aconitia in London,
and that previously to the illness of the deceased in the Isle
of Wight, the prisoner had also purchased of a druggist at
Shanklin some of this deadly poison. In the meantime the
prisoner had gone to Paris, whence on the 8th of December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
he unexpectedly returned, presented himself to the police at
Scotland Yard, in consequence, as he said, of the reports he
had seen in the papers, and, apparently to his surprise, was
taken into custody.</p>

<p>Other incidents in the prisoner’s career and conduct gradually
came to light. Whilst in practice as a surgeon at
Bournemouth he had been in great pecuniary difficulties,
though he had received his share of the property of that one
of the children who had died a minor; an execution had been
put into his house, and at the time of the murder he was
admittedly in straitened circumstances. Again, in the
boy’s boxes at school, in addition to some genuine quinine
powders purchased of a chemist in the Isle of Wight, and
proved to be free from poison, which had been sent to the boy
by the prisoner, were three heavily charged with aconitia, and
two pills containing this deadly drug. Again, he had written
to the boy on the 1st of December that he would call on him
on his way to Paris the next day. He went to Wimbledon,
however, on the evening of the 2nd, with his friend, a
Mr. Tulloch, whom he left at the station, whilst he professed
to have gone to the school, and to whom he said that “he
had seen his brother-in-law, who was much worse, and that
he did not expect he would live long, and that he would not
go on to Paris that night, as Mr. Bedbrook, who was a
director of a continental line, had told him that there was a
bad boat on.” All this was untrue. He had never been to
the school, and Mr. Bedbrook had nothing to do with any
continental line. He had invented the whole story.</p>

<p>In the trial that followed, the interest centred on the impossibility
of detecting vegetable poisons by any chemical
tests, and on the necessity, as in Dr. Pritchard’s case,
with aconite, of relying on the test of tasting the extract
from the various parts of the body. On this test, supported
by the effects observed on injecting drops of the extract under
the skins of mice, which successively died of the operation, and
exhibited the same symptoms before death as resulted from
similar injections of pure aconitia, depended the proof that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
death resulted from this poison. I proceed therefore to give
the medical and analytical evidence in detail.</p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF MEDICAL ATTENDANTS.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Berry</i>, of Wimbledon, the regular medical attendant
at the school, who had known the deceased for a year and a
half, and only had occasion to attend him twice during that
time, once for vaccination, and another time for an eruption
on the skin, his state of health being otherwise good, gave
the following account of the symptoms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Saturday, Dec. 3, I arrived at the school about five minutes
to nine p.m., and was taken by Mr. Bedbrook to Percy John’s room.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
He was in bed, and partly undressed, and in great pain in
the stomach. He also complained of the skin of his face being
drawn, and that there was a sense of constriction in the throat,
in consequence of which he was unable to swallow. He was
retching and vomiting; the vomit was a small quantity of dark-coloured
fluid. I asked him shortly after the cause of his illness
(Mr. Bedbrook had previously made a communication to me), and
said to Percy, ‘Did your brother-in-law ever give you quinine pills
before?’ He said, ‘Yes, at Shanklin.’ I said, ‘Did it make you
like this before?’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘but not so bad.’ There is
nothing in ordinary quinine pills to produce such symptoms. I did
not form an opinion at that time to what the symptoms were due.
During an interval of the vomiting I had some white of egg beaten
up in water given to him, which he was able to swallow, and had
hot linseed poultices placed on his stomach. He was very restless
on the bed&mdash;violently so, throwing himself backwards and forwards
and from side to side. Several people held him to prevent him
from injuring himself. He did not improve at all under this
treatment. Hearing that Dr. Little, a medical man of Wimbledon,
was in the house, I had him sent for, and in about twenty or
twenty-five minutes after I had been in the room he came.
I consulted him, and we determined to inject some morphia. I
left the house to get the morphia and an instrument, being away
five to ten minutes. When I returned the deceased was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
better, and I injected a quarter of a grain of morphia under the
skin, over the region of the stomach. This was done about ten
o’clock. The symptoms abated somewhat about half-past ten, but
not very much. They were still all present, but in a modified
degree, and then they returned again a little before eleven as
severely as before the injection of the morphia. A little before
eleven the deceased asked to have the morphia injected again.
He complained then of pain in his body, but not in any particular
part. I then about eleven injected one-sixth of a grain of morphia
in the same place as before, but it had no apparent effect. In
about ten minutes he became a little unconscious and wandering.
That was the first time I noticed it. His breathing became slower
and sighing, and the heart’s action weaker and weaker, and he died
about twenty minutes after eleven.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his account of the symptoms and the progress of the
case until the deceased’s death, Dr. Berry was fully confirmed
by Dr. Little, who added that at that time they were of
opinion that the death was due to an irritant poison. <i>Dr.
Berry</i> then gave the results of</p>

<p class="psh">THE <i>POST-MORTEM</i> EXAMINATION.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“After his death Dr. Little and I collected some of the vomit
which had been caught in a basin in the bedroom. (He had
previously vomited in the closet.) I also collected some from the
floor of the bedroom and the closet, and the whole was put into a
cup together, and thence into a clean bottle, which was sealed with
my own seal, and given to Mr. Bond on the day of the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination.</p>

<p>“On Tuesday, Dec. 6th, Mr. Bond, Dr. Little, and myself, made
a <i>post-mortem</i> examination. I made some notes at the time which
I have here. With the exception of the paralysis of the lower
limbs, he was a particularly well-developed, muscular lad. The
brain was slightly congested superficially, as well as the substance
of the brain itself. By superficially, I mean the membranes.
There was no fluid in the ventricles of the brain, nor under the
membranes. The pupils of the eyes were dilated; the lips pale
and the tongue bleached; in the right lung were some old
adhesions at the apex, between the lung and the chest wall, the
result of inflammation at some previous time. Both lungs were
healthy, but considerably congested in the lower part. The heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
was healthy muscularly, the valves also healthy; <i>it was almost
entirely empty and flaccid</i>. There was a small quantity of fluid in
the <i>pericardium</i>. The liver was normal in size, but intensely
congested. The kidneys were also normal in size, but much
congested, and the spleen was also congested but normal in size.
The stomach had the mucous membrane congested throughout.
Under the surface, near the large end of the stomach, were six or
eight small yellowish-grey patches, slightly raised, about the size
of a small bean. Towards the smaller end of the stomach were
two or three similar smaller spots. I believe that they were the
result of inflammation, caused recently before death. The stomach
contained three or four ounces of dark fluid, which was carefully
preserved, and of which Mr. Bond took charge. I examined the
<i>duodenum</i>, the first part of which was greatly congested, and there
were patches of congestion on other parts of the small intestines.
Portions of the intestines were taken care of by Mr. Bond, who
also took possession of the stomach itself and portions of the liver,
with the gall bladder, both of the kidneys and the spleen. The
bladder contained three or four ounces of urine, which was drawn
off and taken possession of by Mr. Bond. There were no traces of
inflammation in the <i>peritoneum</i>. The membranes of the spinal
cord were greatly congested. Except the appearance of the lungs
and the curvature of the spine, these were all the appearances I
noted in the <i>post-mortem</i> examination. There was nothing in the
<i>post-mortem</i> examination to account for death from natural causes.
I should say that he died from the effect of some irritant poison,
the administration of which would, I believe, account for all the
appearances. Aconitia is a vegetable alkaloid poison, and the
appearances would be consistent with a fatal dose of that poison,
but I have no special knowledge on the subject.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, the witness repeated, in several
forms, that he had no special knowledge of aconitia, but
some of aconite as used internally for cancer, erysipelas, and
other complaints, and was unable to say whether a grain of
aconitia blended into 20 pills would be good for curvature
of the spine, and that the remedies he applied were for the
violent irritation of the stomach from which up to the time of
his death he believed the deceased was suffering.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“At the <i>post-mortem</i> I examined the spinal cord and the spinal
curvature. The cord was healthy, but congested. The existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
of paralysis is consistent with a healthy spinal cord, but not with
healthy bone and healthy intervertebral cartilages. I did not
examine the condition of the arteries in the neighbourhood of the
curvature.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Are you not aware that there are many cases
on record of death having resulted from the effects of pressure on
the arteries in the regions of these curvatures?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No; but I am not prepared to say that there are
not such cases.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Will you undertake to say that death did not
result from such a cause as that?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I cannot undertake to say. I did not examine to
see the effect of the spinal curvature on the position of the lungs.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Nor what its effect was on the heart?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Do you not know that the lungs are very
much displaced in some cases of spinal curvature?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes, they are.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Is not the heart very much displaced?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“You say this irritation of the stomach was
consistent with poisoning with vegetable alkaloids, and yet you
have never seen a case of such poisoning?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I have not; I did not take means to ascertain
whether the appearances were <i>post-mortem</i>. I know&mdash;only from
Taylor’s ‘Medical Jurisprudence’&mdash;that vegetable alkaloids have
produced these symptoms.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i>, the witness said that “he could not
think that the death was caused by anything he saw in the
curvature of the spine; that if death had been caused by
pressure on the arteries, he should not have expected to find
the symptoms of irritation in the stomach which existed after
death; that displacement of the lungs and heart had not been,
in this case, produced by the curvature of the spine, and, if
there had been much displacement of either, he could not
have failed to observe it.” Dr. Little was equally inexperienced
with Dr. Berry in cases of poisoning, but agreed with
him that the curvature of the spine in the lumbar region had
not displaced either the lungs, the stomach, or the heart, and
that the patches on the surface of the stomach were of recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
date&mdash;“might have existed for days, but not for weeks, but
not without the patient suffering.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond</i>, the Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at the Westminster
Hospital, detailed the various portions of the body
which he put aside for chemical analysis and delivered to
Dr. Dupré; the receipt of two pills given to him by Dr. Berry,
one of which was taken out of one of the capsule boxes after
the boy’s death, and the other brought to Dr. Berry whilst he
was in attendance on the deceased, and two packets of sweets,
and part of a cake. He further confirmed the evidence of
Dr. Berry as to the results of the <i>post-mortem</i> examination,
with the exception, that Dr. Berry had omitted to state that
“the whole of the lungs were somewhat congested, and the
anterior part of them exceedingly so, and that the body was
not decomposed.” In his opinion there was nothing to account
for death from natural causes, and he attributed it to poisoning
by some vegetable alkaloid, such as aconitia, a fatal dose
of which could be given in one of the capsules. The appearances
on the <i>post-mortem</i> examination were, he considered,
such as he should expect to find in death by aconitia. He
agreed also with the other medical men that the grey patches
on the stomach were recent, due to intense irritation, and
would cause the deceased great pain, and induce vomiting.
On the question of the probable effect of the curvature of the
spine, he gave the following most material evidence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The principal curvature was in the lower part of the body;
in the upper part of the spine there was slight anti-posterior or
forward curvature, but it was not enough to affect the position of
the heart or lungs relatively to each other. The cavities of the
chest appeared to me to be deeper from before backward than
usual. The heart was in its right position, except perhaps that
it was higher up in the body than is normal. In the lower region
there was a good deal of lateral curvature. I examined the spinal
cord down to the end of the dorsal vertebræ, and I found the
membranes very much congested, but otherwise it was quite
healthy, to all appearance. I did not examine it with a microscope.
In the lower lumbar region I did not open the canal, for
it was very twisted, and I had difficulty in getting it open. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
disease there could have caused sudden death. The curvature
appeared to be of long standing; the bones were very hard, and
there was no active disease there. I think it impossible that
death could have been caused by pressure produced by the
curvature on one of the arteries.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>cross-examination</i> of Mr. Bond by Mr. Williams was
directed, <i>first</i>, to whether the time at which after taking the
dose the symptoms might be expected to show, depended on
its amount. Of this the witness had no knowledge, but considered
that that would be determined by the fulness or
emptiness of the stomach; and <i>secondly</i>, whether he would
expect to find in the stomach the amount of poison that would
cause death. On this last point the following questions and
answers must be reported:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Would you, supposing death had been occasioned
by aconitia, expect to find the amount of poison that had
caused death, or would it have disappeared?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“I believe it would be possible to use so small a
dose that it could not be found in the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Supposing death caused by aconitia, would
you expect to find the actual amount that caused death?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“That would depend on the amount. My opinion
is that if death was caused by an ordinary amount, traces would
be found.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Of the amount that caused death?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“Not of all.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“And you say aconitia enough to cause death
might leave no trace in the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“Not of aconitia in the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree with this: ‘that the poison found
on analysis would be over and above that used up in causing
death?’”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“No; I should not agree to that, unless it means
that so small a quantity had been absorbed, causing death, leaving
a larger amount which did not cause death. What I mean is, that
the poison which may have caused death has been removed from
the stomach to other organs, and it is quite possible that a larger
amount may be left behind in the stomach than the portion which
has been removed, and caused death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Do you mean that it would be decomposed in
causing death?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“I do not know whether it would or not. I think
not. I will not give a decided answer one way or the other. I
have no idea.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“‘Guy and Ferrier on Forensic Medicine’ is
one of the first authorities, is it not?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree with this, in regard to aconitia,
‘that the commencement of the symptoms may be in a few minutes
or in one or two hours’?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“I do not know anything about poisoning by the
alkaloid aconitia, so I cannot say one way or other.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“I understood you to say, that the ventricles of
the heart were both empty?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“The ventricles and auricles were both empty.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Can you produce any case on record where
such a symptom as that has appeared in poisoning by aconitia?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bond.</i>&mdash;“No, I cannot produce any case on record of
poisoning by aconitia.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i>, the witness declined to speak more positively
on this point, on the ground that he was a surgeon, and
therefore had not had experience in the pathology of such
cases. His only experience in poisoning by alkaloids had
been in a case of strychnia. In reply to the Judge, he admitted
“that other vegetable poisons, even a strong solution
of oil of mustard, would produce the same congestion of the
stomach, and the same yellow marks as had been found; that
a vegetable alkaloid would pass within a minute from the
stomach into the blood, and that it would be more likely to
be found in the liver, kidneys, and urine, than in the heart;
he did not know whether strychnia had been found in the
heart when not discoverable in the blood and the urine.”</p>

with his colleague, the manual operations carried out by both
of them, and the results of those performed by Dr. Dupré

<p class="p1">“The bottle marked ‘A’ contained portions of the liver, spleen,
and kidney. To that was applied Stas’s process. I obtained an
alkaloidal extract which contained a trace of morphia, and which,
placed on the tongue, gave a faint sensation like that produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
aconitia. I reserved that for experiments. To the bottle ‘2,’
which contained part of the bowels, large and small, I applied the
same process. I obtained an extract which I have done nothing
further with&mdash;that is to say, I have not tested the extract. No. 3
contained a fluid, the contents of the stomach, 3½ ozs. This was
treated in a somewhat similar way. The fluid contained a raisin
and a piece of fruit like the top of a carrot or an apple. From
that fluid I obtained, by Stas’s process, an alkaloidal extract,
which was distinctive, and produced a very faint sensation, like
that of aconitia. When placed on the tongue, burning of the lips
was produced, though the extract did not touch the lips. Burning,
tingling&mdash;a kind of numbness peculiar but difficult to
define; a salivation creating a desire to expectorate, a sensation
at the back of the throat of swelling up, and this was followed by
a peculiar seared sensation of the tongue, as if a hot iron had been
drawn over it, or some strong caustic placed on it. I reserved
that alkaloidal extract also for physiological experiments. No. 4 D
contained a human stomach, and 7 ozs. of spirits added to preserve
the stomach. I observed that the stomach was reddened, I think
from congestion, in the region of the greater curvature, and posteriorly.
At one part there was a little pit as if a blister or
inflammatory effusion of lymph had broken. From the stomach
and liquid in the bottle I made an extract by Stas’s process,
and obtained an alkaloidal extract. That I reserved; but I
tasted it, and it had no particular taste that I could recognize.
Next was No. 5 E, containing the urine, 6 ozs. I opened it in
Dr. Dupré’s presence. He found that 4 ozs. of urine had had
2 ozs. of spirit added to preserve it. I made an extract from a
portion of that liquid&mdash;three-fourths. I obtained an alkaloidal
extract which contained a trace of morphia. By a further process
I obtained more morphia, but the first alkaloid I referred to was
more than could be accounted for by the morphia I obtained.
Some of this extract was placed upon my tongue. It produced
the effects of aconitia, which I have already described, in a marked
degree, and a peculiar burning sensation extending downwards
towards the stomach.”</p>

<p><i>By the Judge.</i>&mdash;“I have 50 or 80 alkaloids in my possession,
and I have tasted most of them.”</p>

<p><i>The Solicitor-General.</i>&mdash;“How long did the effects last?”</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“About four hours&mdash;not all the effects, but the burning
on the tongue did. I made an experiment on about one-third of
the urine. I injected it beneath the skin of a mouse. The animal
was obviously affected in two minutes. From that time it exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
symptoms of poisoning, and died in 30 minutes. I made
some experiments on mice from Morson’s aconitia, which I procured
for the purpose. I injected some of that, after dissolving it,
under the skins of several mice. It operated on the mice in a
manner which was undistinguishable from the effect of the urine.
The effects of the two I might say were ridiculously alike. Tartaric
acid was previously used on a mouse in the same quantities
and was found inoperative. I retained portions of the extract
made from the liver, spleen, and kidneys, from the stomach, and
from the contents of the stomach. All contained an alkaloid; two
giving a slight taste of aconitia, and the third no taste. I then
mixed together the alkaloidal extracts, Nos. 1, 3, and 4, and I
injected it under the skin of a mouse, in the same manner, and it
produced effects on the mouse, in nine minutes from that time, of
severe symptoms of poisoning, and the animal died in 22 minutes.
These symptoms were precisely similar to those produced by Morson’s
aconitia. No. 6, the vomit, contained nearly ten ounces, or half
a pint, of thick, pasty fluid stuff, with which also were spirits of
wine. Dr. Dupré pointed out marks showing that to 5oz. of vomit
5oz. of spirit had been added. There was a good deal of solid
matter in the vomit, which must have been of a solid character.
I examined the solid portion and found it consisted of pieces of
fat, a very small portion of the muscular fibre of some animal,
pieces of onion, a little starch, probably that of wheat, a slice of
candied peel like that put on the top of cake, a piece of apple pulp,
raisins, and some pineapple, with just the odour of pineapple drops.
I subsequently examined with the microscope the vomit again, the
solid portions, to see if I could find anything corresponding to the
root of aconite or the root of horseradish. I found neither. I
made an extract from the vomit, and obtained an alkaloidal
extract. The extract had no trace of morphia or of quinine. I
applied it to the tongue with a very powerful result, such as that
of aconitia. The severe forms of attack lasted for 6½ hours; it
lasted for that time, though the effects did not then cease. I took
1-24th part for experiment on a mouse. I injected it into the
back of a mouse. It was severely affected in 2½ minutes, the
symptoms continuing till the time of its death, 15½ minutes after.
Those symptoms were parallel with those of aconitia. In my
judgment the vomit submitted to me contained a considerable
quantity of aconitia.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Can you fix what quantity?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Approximately it was not less than one-seventh, and
not more than one-fourth of a grain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What would be a fatal dose of aconitia to a human
being?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“There is only one fatal case I know of, and in that
death was caused by about one-sixteenth of a grain. What is
known to have caused death was not less than one-twenty-first of
a grain, and not more than one-thirteenth. Each of the boxes
produced contained capsules. There were only two pills in them.
They were gelatine-coated pills, like those in the bottle. I
examined those pills, or rather I saw Dr. Dupré do so. They were
simply five-grain quinine pills.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“The packet of sweetmeats, No. 8. Did they contain
any traces of poison?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“No. 9, the cake?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“That contained no traces of poison of any kind.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“No. 10, the capsules, did you examine them?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They are simply gelatine capsules.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You have told us there were some pills loose?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; there were four, and they were similar to those
I have just referred to, quinine, gelatine-coated pills. There was
some sugar in a paper. Some of the powders were in larger papers
than others; six were in large. They contained 1½ grains of
disulphate of quinine. There were 14 smaller papers containing
powders. They were tied together in a bundle numbering from 7
to 20. They varied considerably in weight, the lowest weighed
6-10ths of a grain, the highest 1⅛ grains. Three of the powders
differed in appearance. The average weight of those which were
quinine were 9-10ths of a grain. I examined those powders, and
I found they consisted, eleven of them, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 18, and 20, of disulphate of quinine simply, the ordinary
quinine powders, but varying considerably in weight, from 3-10ths
of a grain up to 1¼ grains. Of the other three, my attention was
drawn to No. 16 by Dr. Dupré; it was a different colour, as also
were Nos. 17 and 19. No. 16 was an obvious mixture; there were
two substances clearly to a chemist, who would have noticed the
mixture at once. It was a very pale fawn, the mixture; the other
was a pure white. No. 16 weighed 1<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> grs. or 1·79 grs. No. 17
weighed ·88 of a grain; No. 19 weighed 1·26, or about 1¼ grs. In
the No. 16, which appeared to be a mixture, it looked as if the
quinine had been damaged. I tasted it, and in about three
minutes a startling sensation came on. The sensation was severe
for three hours, and then gradually went away after dinner.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did you make a special examination of the pills?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What amount of aconitia was in the pills?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Decimal 83. In the quinine pills there was ·96. I
tested the action of this quinine on a mouse. In three and a half
minutes after I had administered it the effect was the same as
before. In No. 17 there was aconitia, and in 19 there was
aconitia; I cannot tell you how much. In 17 and 19 I noticed the
difference in colouring between the ordinary quinine powders.
The proportion of aconitia was considerably less in 16 as compared
with 19.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is it usual to wrap pills in tinfoil?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Or to put them in boxes of this description?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Oh, no.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Were these two pills examined by yourself and Dr.
Dupré?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; one weighed 3 grs. and another 2¾. There was
nothing particular in the appearance. There was a little bitterness
at first with the 2¾ grain pill. I cut out a small piece with
a penknife. We all took a little piece, I only took the 22nd part
of a grain. Part of it was used for the microscope. It caused intense
burning. The bitterness of quinine was followed by intense
burning, and the same symptoms I have already described, but of
a more severe kind. I injected some of that into the back of a
mouse. It exhibited symptoms of poisoning, was very ill in two
minutes, and it died in 4½ minutes. I came to the conclusion
that there was ·45 of a grain of aconitia in that pill, or nearly half
a grain. No. 12 was the sherry. I found no trace of poison in
that, nor in the wafers. I have said the urine contained aconitia,
showing that the poison had been absorbed into the blood, had
passed through the tissues of the body, and had become excreted.
I have said I found in the extracts traces of morphia. I have
heard of the injection of morphia by Dr. Little and Dr. Berry
during the last hour of the boy’s illness. The traces I found were
such as I should have expected to find from that, both in the urine
and probably in the liver too.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Could a fatal dose of aconitia be administered in
such a capsule as this?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Oh, yes. Many times a fatal dose. I have put into
one a grain of aconitia, and into another a half-grain.”</p>

<p>[Capsules produced by Witness, and shown to Judge and Jury,
to show how little space in the capsule was occupied even by the
grain of aconitia.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>Witness continued.&mdash;“The symptoms lasted after tasting the pill
7½ hours, notwithstanding having taken a meal.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Supposing aconitia taken in a capsule of this description,
would it prevent a taste on the tongue?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“I believe there is no test of aconitia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No specific or characteristic chemical test.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What are the tests?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“We can tell chemically that it is an alkaloid. Then
there is the physiological test, the effect on the tongue and the
neighbouring parts, and its general effect on the system if taken in
any quantity. Then the other physiological test is that it will kill,
after a definite course of symptoms, as shown in my experiments
with the mice.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you any doubt that you did find aconitia in
the portions of the body you examined and in the vomit?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Not the least. I have heard the description of the
deceased boy. He had symptoms such as would arise from poisoning
by aconite. His symptoms approached more nearly to those
caused by that than any other poison. Judging from the symptoms
discovered at the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, I should say that
he died from poisoning by aconitia.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is aconitia a medicine commonly used for spinal
diseases in this country?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“I do not know if you are aware of its use here by
medical men?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; the British Pharmacopœia orders it for external
use, but makes no mention of any dose for internal use. It was
formerly tried a quarter of a century ago, or thirty years ago, but
it was given up because it was too dangerous.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i> by <i>Mr. Williams</i>, after he had stated
that he had never seen an acknowledged death from aconitia,
but founded his opinion not only from tasting, testing, and
the experiments on mice, but from his reading, and that he
knew that it was used in France and Germany, but not
that it was sold at the French chemist’s in the Haymarket
as a patent medicine, the examination proceeded as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would you look at that book&mdash;is that it?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes; that is the book.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you there find a formula for pills with aconitia
in them?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“And drops?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“For internal use?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No. The drops are for dropping in the ear; the
pills are for internal use.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Also for ointment?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“And in the British Pharmacopœia you will find
‘Unguentum Aconitiæ,’ 8 grains of aconitia to 1 ounce of lard?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is Sidney Ringer an acknowledged authority on
therapeutics?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you know his books?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree with this:&mdash;‘Aconite is used externally
in the form of liniment or ointment to relieve pain?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“The ‘Unguentum Aconitiæ’ alludes to aconitia, does
it not?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, the ointment does.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is that applied in neuralgic cases?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, it is used in neuralgia and rheumatism.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree with the statement, ‘That a piece of
ointment the size of a bean or nut should be applied with friction,
which enhances its efficacy?’”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, to the skin.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“A piece the size of a bean would contain half a grain
of aconitia, would it not?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree that the application in such a case
will cut short pain?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“And prevent sickness?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I do not know about that. Sickness is not a usual
symptom in neuralgia and rheumatism.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Do you agree with this, that ‘Aconite diminishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
sensibility, and it has been used internally in various painful
diseases?’”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, aconite.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you heard of the use of aconitia in typhoid
fever?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; I have heard of its use in fevers generally, but
not in typhoid.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“In the <i>Journal of Medicine</i>, No. 27, March, 1882,
by Dr. Phipson&mdash;&mdash;“<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Solicitor-General</i> objected that that was something written
within a few days.</p>

<p><i>Mr. M. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Then I will put this question generally.
Have you heard of its use internally in severe cases of fever?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, I have heard of its use in fever, but not in
typhoid.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you heard of its use in pleuro-pneumonia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, in very minute doses; it is recommended in a
journal of medicine which is edited by a man who is not a medical
man.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Your collaborateur, Dr. Dupré, is not a medical
man, is he?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“With regard to the symptoms&mdash;the dilated pupils&mdash;are
they not invariably dilated three days after death?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“After a natural death. The surface of the tongue
being rough is no sure sign of aconitia poisoning. Congestion of the
brain has been observed in aconite poisoning, but is no sure sign.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Has bloody fluid in the bag of the heart been met
with in aconitia poisoning?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would you expect to find the ventricles and
auricles empty?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It has been observed in poisoning by preparations of
aconitia; but in the only case of aconitia poisoning I know of the
state of the heart is not mentioned. You will find it in the <i>Philadelphia
Journal of Medicine</i> of November last.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is congested liver a sign of aconitia poisoning?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The congestion of the internal viscera is an important
sign of poisoning by aconitia. The congestion could be caused by
various means. The kidneys being congested was consistent with
aconite poisoning, but not dependent on it. The same could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
said of congestion of the spleen. I am prepared to admit that
cases may have occurred in which congestion has been caused
without poison. The patches in the stomach may have existed
days before death, but not without causing pain. I commenced
the analysis of the contents of the stomach on the 10th of December.
I commenced the analysis of the vomit the same day. I
commenced to examine the urine the same day.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You say the bottle C, No. 3, contained matter from
which you extracted an alkaloidal extract. Would you expect to
find an alkaloid from morphia in the contents of the stomach?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; but I should expect to find it in the urine, and
I found in that more alkaloid than was consistent with morphia.
That requires the most delicate test. By a further extraction I got
a little more morphia.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“The precise process I ask you for in testing the
alkaloidal extract.”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I took half the contents of the stomach. I mixed
it with such a quantity of rectified spirit as, with the spirit previously
added by Dr. Dupré, made the proportion of spirit two
volumes of spirit to one volume of matter. The liquid I took was
acid in reaction. The liquid stood over from Sunday to Monday.
It was then filtered. The insoluble part was well washed with
rectified spirit. The clear liquid was then evaporated at a temperature
below that of the human body, till it was almost solid. The
portion I had not dissolved in spirit was then treated with an
additional quantity of spirit, to which a little quantity of tartaric
acid was added. The mixture was then warmed to 140 deg. Fahr.
It was then cooled. The insoluble part was well washed with
spirit, and the clear liquid evaporated at a temperature below that
of the human body. A fairly solid residue was obtained. I now
obtained two alcoholic extracts, each of which was treated in a
precisely similar manner, but separately, by digesting them with
warm absolute alcohol, or rather tepid, till the alcohol would take
up and dissolve nothing more. The solutions in absolute alcohol
were filtered and evaporated nearly to dryness. They were then
treated with a little water. They were found to be acid in reaction,
and the two solutions&mdash;that is to say, that from the plain spirit,
and the other from the tartaric acid spirit&mdash;were mixed. Care
was taken that they remained just faintly acid, and the solution
was then agitated with washed ether. The ether was allowed to
separate; it was drawn off, and replaced by fresh ether. This
operation was carried out five times. The ether was set apart,
and allowed to evaporate at a temperature below boiling point;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
that was reserved as not containing any alkaloid. The residue
was oily and partially dissoluble with water; it was of a brownish
colour. It was not weighed, but was a very appreciable quantity.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Were these tests conducted for aconitia only?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Oh, no; I tested for other poisons. The aqueous
liquid which separated from the ether was made alkaline by carbonate
of soda, and it was then agitated with a mixture of washed
ether and washed chloroform. The ether-chloroform solution was
then allowed to separate, drawn off, replaced by washed ether, the
ether again drawn off, and again replaced by ether, which was
again drawn off. These chloroform-ether mixtures were mixed and
evaporated, and finally dried in vacuo over oil of vitriol. Before
it was placed in the vacuum, I examined it to see if there were
any volatile alkaloids, which would be distinguished by their
peculiar odour. There were none. I then weighed it, after
drying, and found its weight ·108 of a grain, or rather more than
1-10th of a grain. It was slightly crystalline in appearance. I
tasted it, putting a little on my tongue. That was one of my
taste tests.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“That was afterwards dissolved, and part of it was
applied to the mouse?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Yes, but I had previously tested it for an alkaloid.
I went through the same operation with the vomit and the urine,
with only minor differences of details here and there as occasion
required.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“You say that the effect on the tongue was characteristic
of aconitia. Was it characteristic of nothing else?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Nothing else that I know of.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Not of veratria?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; I have tried that on the tongue, and its effect
is different. I do not recollect that delphinia is like aconitia.
Morphia has no marked bitterness. I know that the taste is very
different from other substances. Pepperine has an immediate
burning effect.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is not phosphoric acid a test for aconitia?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“No; it is given as a test, except by those who have
studied it recently. I have made experiments with pure aconitia
with no results. The book produced is written by an authority.
Fluckijer, in his work on the subject, gives the reaction of aconitia,
but it is German aconitia he refers to; it is very different to English
aconitia. I see no reference to English aconitia in Fluckijer.”</p>

<p>The book was handed back to counsel, and Mr. Montagu Williams
said the date was 1879.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Witness, cross-examined further.</i>&mdash;“The solution injected into the
mouse was measured on each occasion. About three minims of
liquid altogether was injected. With the exception of the urine
and one of the vomits, the injections were unmixed. He believed,
of course, that too much reliance must not be placed on experiments
on animals.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is it not a recognised fact that alkaloids are found
in the human body after death, irrespective of poisons?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is a question still <i>sub judice</i>. It has been asserted
that such is the case where the stomach or other viscera has been
much decomposed.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“What are called cadaveric alkaloids, utterly irrespective
of the administration of poison?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is so asserted.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Is not Stas’s test a mode of extracting cadaveric
alkaloids?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Cadaveric as well as natural alkaloids.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would these cadaveric alkaloids produce the same
effects as the natural alkaloids?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“They have been described as producing the same
effects; but I have seen no description of one producing the effects
of aconitia. There is a test distinguishing these cadaveric alkaloids
from all natural alkaloids, except morphia and veratria, and certainly
from aconitia. That test was applied to these extracts when
no morphia was present,&mdash;the reduction of the ferricyanide to the
ferro-cyanide of potassium. There is an authority for the method
of obtaining and distinguishing these cadaveric alkaloids. I was
one of the first to point out that alkaloidal extracts from the
stomachs of the dead would kill frogs if injected under the skin. I
have read most of the foreign writers on this subject. I have not
read Peschi, and cannot say whether they produce pricking of the
tongue. I do not remember any of them describing sensations
produced on the tongue from cadaveric alkaloids, similar to those
from aconitia. Many things would produce prickings on the
tongue.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Have you found the ordinary residue of the stomach
from the dead poison the lower animals?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I have never known it to do so. I will not say it is
not so.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“How long after the administration of aconitia would
you expect the symptoms to appear?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“From a few minutes to an hour and a half.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Would the time of action depend upon the dose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The probabilities are that a large dose would soonest
produce effect. The smallest dose that has produced death has
been between 1-21 gr. and 1-13 gr., or about 1-16 gr.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On <i>re-examination</i> by the <i>Solicitor-General</i>, the <i>Witness</i>
explained that it was when corpses were putrefying that the
cadaveric alkaloids were produced. He had procured alkaloidal
extracts from the urine, viscera and stomach, and ascertained
the effects of them upon mice: had made twenty-two experiments
this year: there were two cases of heart disease,
and four of the liver, kidneys, spleen, vomit, and six from the
urine. He had also, in six instances, taken from the urine of
living persons, and in three from that of healthy dead persons.
Those extracts had no effect on his tongue. He had had
many years’ experience, and certainly never tasted anything
like aconitia, and he had tried these alkaloidal extracts on the
same number of mice without the animals suffering except
from the puncture. One of these mice, he added, he had
killed with the <i>three-thousandths</i> of a grain, and <i>two-thousandths</i>
of a grain was always fatal to a mouse. To a
question by the judge, he said “it would make a great difference
in the time when the severe symptoms appeared, whether
the poison was swallowed directly and whether it came into
direct contact with the tongue.” Dr. Dupré confirmed in
every detail the statements of his colleague. “In his case
the effects of tasting the alkaloid from the urine continued
over four hours, and that from the vomit over six hours,
though he took lunch and dinner during that time. In the
vomit he did not find any trace of quinine which he should
have expected had aconitia been given in conjunction with
quinine.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE PREVIOUS ACTS OF THE PRISONER.</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage in 1879, the prisoner set up in
practice at Bournemouth, whence in April, 1880, he went for
a six months’ trip to America. Early in 1881, he was in
great pecuniary difficulties, and had to part with his furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
to pay an execution out of his house, and again went to
America on the 30th of August. Three days before he sailed,
whilst staying with his mother at Ventnor, he visited Percy
John at Shanklin, where the boy was staying with the Chapmans,
and promised to return on the Monday, the 29th,
before he left England. It was supposed that he did so, and
it was then, according to the boy’s statement before reported,
that he gave him a pill, after which he was taken ill in much
the same way as at Blenheim House in the December following.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
From America he returned on the 17th of October,
and after a visit to Ventnor, where he got a cheque, which
was subsequently dishonoured, cashed by a tradesman (Price
Owen), he was in London on the 1st of December, staying at
the Nelson Hotel, Portland-road. His actions are now taken
up by the following witness, to whom, and to whose brother,
the prisoner had from time to time advanced money, in the
case of the brother pawning his surgical instruments and
watch, on the 24th of November, in order to lend him five
pounds.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p><i>John Law Tulloch</i>, a student of medicine living in Alma
Square, St. John’s Wood, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have known the prisoner for some time. I did not
see him till December of last year from the previous April.
I saw him on the 1st of last December, a Thursday night, at
my house. He said he was staying at Nelson’s Hotel, and was
going to Paris the next night. He had dinner at my house. I
went with him to Nelson’s Hotel, and assisted in packing his luggage.
I went with him from the hotel to Waterloo Station. We
had with us a leather case, a handbag, and a rug. He said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
thought he would go first of all to see his brother-in-law at Wimbledon.
We went to Wimbledon together at about six in the
evening.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> He said he was going up to the school, at Mr. Bedbrook’s.
I waited for him in the public-house opposite. He came back to me
in about twenty minutes. He said that he had seen his brother-in-law,
who was very much worse. He added that he did not expect
him to live long. He said he had seen Mr. Bedbrook, who was a
director of one of the Continental lines, and that gentleman had
told him that it was as well that he should not go that night, as
there was a bad boat on the service. We returned to town, and
went together to the Comedy Theatre in Panton-street. After
that we went to Stone’s, a public-house opposite the theatre, and
while we were there he wrote the cheque produced, on the Wilts and
Dorset Bank, dated December 2, 1881, for 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, payable to
J. L. Tulloch. He asked me to try and obtain the cash for it. We
went first to the Adelphi Hotel in Adam-street, but could not get
it cashed there. We then drove to the Eyre Arms, St. John’s-wood,
which is close to where I reside. Mr. Perrot, the landlord,
cashed the cheque, and I gave the money to the prisoner. I then
parted from him, and arranged to meet him on the following day
at the Adelphi Hotel. I saw him there about three or four in the
afternoon. I was to meet him at half-past one, to see him off by
a train at 2.50, but I do not know from what station. He said
that he was too late for the mid-day train, and could not go until
night. I went with him to the Horseshoe to have some refreshment.
When there we found that one of the bags received from
the Eyre Arms contained coppers. We returned to the house and
obtained a 5<i>l.</i> note in exchange. He left me there about six. I
did not hear of him again till he was in custody. The cheque was
dishonoured. On the 13th of December he wrote saying the
amount would be in my hands very soon, and he was surprised at
my attitude towards, or, rather against him.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On <i>cross-examination</i>, the <i>witness</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have said to-day the prisoner said on December 2, ‘the boy
is very much worse, and I don’t think he will last long.’ I do not
think he said anything about his having passed his examination
that day. I was quite sober. I do not owe him money.”</p>

<p class="p1">At five minutes to seven, on the evening of the 3rd of
December, he was at Blenheim House telling Mr. Bedbrook
he wished to see his brother-in-law. The boy was brought
into the dining-room, some wine got for the prisoner, and
some powdered white sugar to cure, as he said, the alcohol in
it. He then had with him a leather bag from which he took
some Dundee cakes and sweets, of which the boy and the
master partook.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bedbrook</i> deposed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“About a quarter past 7 the prisoner said to me, ‘Oh, by the
way, when I was in America, I thought of you and your boys, and
I thought what excellent things these capsules would be for the
boys to take nauseous medicine in.’ He produced two boxes of
capsules from his bag, and said, ‘I should like you to try one to
see how easily they can be swallowed.’ I examined them, and put
one in my mouth.”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“Was the box wrapped in paper, or was it handed
to you open?”</p>

<p><i>The Witness.</i>&mdash;“It was handed to me open.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the capsules were here produced.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Montagu Williams.</i>&mdash;“I do not think they are all of one
size.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Poland.</i>&mdash;“These are the original capsules.”</p>

<p><i>Witness</i> continuing, said&mdash;“I swallowed an empty capsule, and
it was very easy to swallow.”</p>

<p><i>The Witness</i> continuing, said&mdash;“The prisoner took the lids off
both of the boxes. While I was examining a capsule the prisoner
was filling another with sugar, with a little spade spoon. He then,
having apparently filled it with sugar, said, ‘If you shake it the
medicine will come down to one end.’ He then handed the capsule
to the boy Percy John, who was sitting on his right, about a yard
from him. In doing so he said, ‘Here, Percy; you are a swell
pill taker; take this, and show Mr. Bedbrook how easy it is to
swallow.’ Percy John then put the capsule in his mouth as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
back as he could, and at one gulp it was gone. I remarked to him,
‘That is soon gone, my boy.’ The prisoner then said, ‘I must be
going now,’ and I then looked at the time-table to see the next
train for London. It was then 7.20 or thereabouts, and I told
him the next train left at 7.21, and advised him to go at once or
he would miss his train. Previous to this I had asked him to
remain a little longer, until the 7.50 train. He said, ‘I cannot, as
I have to catch a train at eight o’clock at London Bridge, <i>en route</i>
to the Continent.’ He said he was going to Florence, <i>viâ</i> Paris.
Passing through the drawing-room I remarked to him that I
thought the curvature of the spine of the deceased was getting
worse. He observed on that occasion that he did not think the
boy would last long. I did not make any reply to that. He then
left the house at about 21 or 22 minutes past seven o’clock. He
left behind the two boxes of capsules. I placed them on the
dining-room waggon.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“From the time Percy John had swallowed the
capsule how many minutes elapsed before the prisoner said, ‘I
must be going now’?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“He said it within five minutes. After the prisoner
left the house I returned to the dining-room, where Percy John
was. When I got back deceased said, ‘I feel as if I had an attack
of heartburn.’ I think after that I returned to my guests. He
was reading the newspapers.”</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Montagu Williams</i> objected to the statements of the
deceased being put in evidence.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> said that evidence as to symptoms could be
received when made by the deceased.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Examination continued.</i>&mdash;“I returned to him in five minutes.
He said, ‘I feel as I felt when my brother-in-law had given me a
quinine pill at Shanklin.’ He said he would like to go to bed. I
gave orders that he should go to bed. Mr. Bell carried him
upstairs.”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“At what time was this?”</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“Between eight and nine.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The fatal attack now came on as previously described. In
the box with the capsules were some little pills, and in the
boy’s own box in his bedroom a small box of quinine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
powders, and another with two pills wrapped in tinfoil.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In
the previous year, when the prisoner was in America, Mr.
Bedbrook had received from him a box of pills, with a letter,
saying that “he had met some one in America suffering from
the same complaint as the boy, who had derived great benefit
from taking medicine similar to that now sent, and requesting
Mr. Bedbrook to see the boy take the medicine.” “I afterwards,”
said the witness, “gave the boy one of the pills, and
next morning he complained of being very unwell. At that
time the box was in his bedroom, and Percy John said, ‘I
will take no more of them.’ I thereupon took the pills
downstairs, and until the box produced was found, was under
the impression that I had thrown it away.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p class="psh">PURCHASE OF ACONITIA BY THE PRISONER.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Charles Albert Smith</i>, a chemist at Ventnor, proved
that on the 28th of August, 1881, the prisoner purchased of
him 3 grains of sulphate of atropine, and 2 grains of aconitia,
and that he had labelled the latter “Aconitine, poison.”
As he had previously made up prescriptions for the prisoner,
and knew him as a medical man, he sold the poison to him
without hesitation. Aconitia, he believed, was commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
used for neuralgia and cancer, to relieve the palpitations in
heart disease, and as a diuretic in dropsy.</p>

<p>On the 24th of November, 1881, the prisoner asked for
2 grains of aconitia at Messrs. Allen &amp; Hanbury’s, of
Plough-court, Lombard-street; and as the assistant, on reference
to the Medical Directory, found the prisoner’s name as a
medical man practising at Bournemouth, he sold them to him
without further precaution than labelling it “Poison.” On
the evidence of this witness, Mr. Dodd, a difficulty arose,
from his having at first entertained the impression that it was
“atropia” which he had sold. The price of this drug to a medical
man would have been only threepence a grain, whilst that
of aconitia would be 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> In the petty-cash book of the
day, among entries of sales marked “C”&mdash;the sign that they
were sold to a medical man&mdash;was one of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but none of
3<i>d.</i>; and Mr. Dodd, after consulting with the other assistant
who was present at the sale, became convinced that it was
“aconitia,” and not “atropia,” which he had sold to the
prisoner. “There is also,” he said, “a difference in colour,
atropia being white, and aconitia yellowish-white.”</p>

<p>A previous attempt to purchase aconitia was proved by
Mr. Stilling,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> an assistant of Messrs. Bell &amp; Co., Oxford-street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
on the 20th of November. Twice before that day the
prisoner had had prescriptions made up there, which he wrote
in the shop, and marked as for his own use. These contained
morphia and atropia, but at the bottom of the second of these
prescriptions he had written, “Digitaline, pure, 5 grains.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>By the Judge.</i>&mdash;“He told me he practised at Bournemouth.”</p>

<p><i>By Mr. Poland.</i>&mdash;“He led us to infer that he was accustomed
to prescribe this digitaline for internal use. It is the active
principle of foxglove, and is a poison. While he was in the shop
I looked at our stock of digitaline, and found it more coloured
than I expected. I told him that, and said I would provide him
some fresh from the manufacturer in a few days. I did that
because he had laid stress on its being pure. He did not say
when he would call again, but in a few days. Dr. Lamson himself
then struck out the lower part of the prescription as to the
digitaline. All the rest was made up&mdash;morphia and the sulphate
of atropia. He waited in the shop while it was made up, and
paid 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> for it. In a few days he called again; it was after
the 20th of November. He then asked for one grain of aconitia
for internal use. I knew it was poison, and I recommended him
to procure it where he was better known. Nothing more was
said, and he left the shop. I believe he wrote an order for one
grain of aconitia in the shop, and I believe he tore it up himself.
Except seeing him on the 11th and the 16th I knew nothing of
him before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span></p>

<p><i>By Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“He told me on the 11th that he was
staying at Nelson’s Hotel, in Portland Street. I cannot swear that
there was a written order for the aconitia. I believed that when I
went from the shop for my fellow-assistant, Dr. Lamson wrote the
order; and then when we returned he tore it up. I have not
said anything about that order before to-day, because I was not
asked. Only the atropia and morphia were bought on both
occasions.”</p>

<p><i>Re-examined.</i>&mdash;“When he asked me for the aconitia, knowing it
was a potent poison, I went to consult a fellow-assistant, and then
he wrote the order, as I believe.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">It may be noted here that the larger quinine powders in
the box which were found to be pure were proved to have
been purchased of Mr. Littlefield, a chemist at Ventnor, on
the 13th of October, 1880; that he knew nothing of the
smaller ones, which were proved by Dr. Stevenson to contain
aconitia, and that he never kept that drug in his shop. In
this he was confirmed by his assistant, Mr. Bright, who
identified his own handwriting on the box in which they had
been sold. The smaller quinine powders were not traced.</p>

<p class="psh">THE SURRENDER OF THE PRISONER.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December, the prisoner called at Scotland
Yard and saw Inspector Butcher, who gave the following
account of the interview:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“When the prisoner came there and saw me, he said, ‘Mr.
Butcher?’ and I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘My name is Lamson.
I am Dr. Lamson, whose name has been mentioned in connection
with the death at Wimbledon.’ I asked him to be seated, and he
continued, ‘I have called to see what is to be done about it. I
considered it best to do so. I read the account in the public
papers in Paris, and came over this morning. I have only just
now arrived in London. I am very unwell, and much upset about
this matter, and not in a fit state at all to have undertaken this
journey.’ I then communicated with Chief Superintendent Williamson,
who said to the prisoner, ‘You will have to remain a
time.’ I remained with him. His wife was present. He conversed
on various subjects for some time, and then he said, ‘Where
is the delay? I thought I would come here and leave my address.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
I am going into the country to Chichester, so that you will know
where to find me, and I will attend the inquest. I have travelled
from Paris <i>viâ</i> Havre and Southampton. I went over <i>viâ</i> Dover
and Calais.’ After this I again saw Chief Superintendent Williamson,
who called the prisoner into another room. I said, ‘Dr.
Lamson, this case has been fully considered, and it has been
decided to charge you with causing the death of Percy John. I
therefore take you into custody, and charge you with causing the
death of Percy Malcolm John, at Blenheim House, Wimbledon, on
the 3rd of December instant.’ He said, ‘Very well; do you think
bail will be accepted? I hope the matter will be kept as quiet as
possible, for the sake of my relations.’ I told him he would now
be taken to Wandsworth police-court, and the question of bail
would rest with the magistrate. I conveyed him in a cab to the
Wandsworth police-station. On the way he said, ‘You will have
my father here in a day or two. I hope it will be stated that
I came to Scotland Yard voluntarily. I came from Paris on
purpose.’ I said, ‘Certainly.’”</p>

<p class="p1">On searching the box which he had left at Euston Station
among various articles, chiefly of plate, a medical memorandum
book was found, from which the Solicitor-General read
an extract on the “effects of acrid vegetable poisons,” and
then closed the case for the prosecution.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Montagu Williams</i>, having previously had the letter
read from the Home Office, refusing to allow an independent
analysis of the contents of the body on the part of the
prisoner, then commenced.</p>

<p class="psh">THE DEFENCE.</p>

<p>Of the speech for the defence, which lasted the greater part
of two days, and dealt with the case with extreme minuteness,
it will be sufficient to give a summary, especially as its leading
points were remarked upon so fully in the charge of the
learned Judge.</p>

<p>On the question whether the death of the boy was from
poison, <i>Mr. Montagu Williams</i>, necessarily laid great stress
on the admitted inability of the scientific witnesses to rely on
any other test than that of taste. “Scientifically,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
“it was a leap in the dark, and they had to traverse a region
of science up to the present moment unexplored. Who knows
about aconite? and echo answers who? What was it? The
root of monkshood. Aconite was one form, and aconitia was
the active principle of that form: and up to the present
moment, with the exception of one reported case, there was
not a single authority on the subject.” Pursuing this subject,
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The first medical witness called was Dr. Berry, who on the
night of December 3rd was visiting at Blenheim House, where he
saw the poor boy until his death, and observed all the symptoms
under which the unfortunate lad suffered. What were they? The
lad told him that he was suffering from heartburn, and where was
the symptom of heartburn in the administration of aconite in the
evidence of the experts that had been brought before them? What
medical gentleman had said that heartburn was a sign of aconitia
poisoning? The poor lad was found vomiting, and Dr. Berry and
another medical man, Dr. Little, treated him for irritation of the
stomach. Neither of them treated him for, or thought of, poisoning.
The boy was taken from the bath-room, where he was found,
to the bed from which he never rose, and from first to last all the
symptoms were those of irritation of the stomach. From nine
o’clock to past eleven no attempt was made to use the stomach
pump; and if the medical gentlemen thought poison had been
taken, they never used anything to relieve him, or what might
have saved him. If poison was in the minds of these medical men,
why did they not treat him for such? It was clear, therefore,
there was no thought of poison; and Dr. Berry admitted in
evidence that it never occurred to him that it was so until the
<i>post-mortem</i> examination. He said he then thought the death was
from alkaloid poisoning. It was the duty of him (Mr. Williams)
to cross-examine him on vegetable alkaloids. What was his knowledge?
His knowledge was a blank, and he admitted he knew
nothing of vegetable alkaloids. Therefore, the first expert witness
called for the prosecution&mdash;who had, moreover, the benefit of seeing
the symptoms in life&mdash;broke down altogether. It was his case
that the theories of the prosecution were of the most speculative
character. Dr. Little differed somewhat, and said, ‘We came to
the conclusion that the boy was dying from a vegetable poison
an hour before his death,’ while Dr. Berry said it was not until the
<i>post-mortem</i> examination that they thought anything of the sort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
Dr. Little says he read about vegetable alkaloids in his student
days. Both those gentlemen, who give the opinion that death
resulted from vegetable alkaloids, knew nothing whatever about
the subject. Then they had Mr. Bond, a gentleman of great
scientific attainments, well known in these courts, who gave the
results of the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, and he (the learned counsel)
thought it would not be straining the imagination too much to
say that that gentleman gave the first idea of poisoning in the
matter. Mr. Bond said he came to the conclusion that death
resulted from a vegetable alkaloid, and again the same line of
questions and answers followed. Mr. Bond admitted he had
never known a case of such poisoning. And so the jury were
asked to form a verdict on the evidence of two persons who had
seen the symptoms of the deceased in life, and were entirely
ignorant of the signs of vegetable alkaloid poisoning, and of Mr.
Bond, who was not present, and who admitted he was also ignorant
upon the subject. They were asked to give a verdict on which an
existence hung, and to say they had no doubt whatever that
aconitia was in the body. He could only say up to that time
there was not one single piece of evidence that the boy died by
aconitia poisoning.”</p>

<p class="p1">Passing thence to the evidence of Doctors Stevenson and
Dupré, whose tests, the former said, “rested on his taste, on
the effects of the solutions on the mice and his reading,” he
called the attention of the jury to Dr. Stevenson’s admission
that the results of most of these tests were consistent with
other causes, though consistent with aconitia, and ridiculed
the effects on the mice as confirmatory tests, quoting the
remarks of Lord Coleridge that tests upon animals were
always found to be most unreliable, and of Professor Tidy,
“that although useful at arriving at results, they sometimes
failed, and were not reliable.” “If they used their common
sense they must see that that must be so. So delicate was
the constitution of a mouse that one of those experimented on
had died because the injecting needle had been stuck in a
quarter of an inch too far. Mice would sometimes die from
fright, and also from the injection of water, and yet because
these mice spoken of died in five minutes they were asked to
say that they died of aconitia poisoning.” As to the test of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
taste, Dr. Stevenson had admitted “that it was like some
other alkaloids, and not like others.” The question of the
production of cadaveric alkaloids was still <i>sub judice</i>. He
was prevented, by the refusal of the Home Office, to allow
experts on the prisoner’s behalf to be present at the analytical
examination, from calling scientific witnesses to rebut&mdash;“an
act that was trifling with life&mdash;a beautiful bit of red-tapeism;
and, if it was contrary to all practice, the sooner it
was done away with the better.”</p>

<p>On the second point, whether if aconitia was given, it was
given by the prisoner, <i>Mr. Montagu Williams</i>, after alluding
to the way in which his admitted poverty had been pressed
against the prisoner, called the attention of the jury to the
facilities the prisoner would have had of poisoning his brother-in-law
during the boy’s visit at his house in the summer, or his
projected visit at Christmas; to the fact that the supposed
attempt was made in the full light of gas, and in the presence
of both the master and the victim; that there was no proof
that he had brought a capsule ready charged with poison, and
that he must have manipulated one before their eyes, and
that it was not by his request that powdered white sugar was
brought. “What was there to prevent lump sugar being
brought?” As to the pills found with the capsules,</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Where did they come from? No pills were given to the boy
by the prisoner, for Mr. Bedbrook was present the whole time and
no mention was made of pills. Where was the boy all the afternoon?
In the room downstairs, and able to move about, though
this was studiously concealed by everyone from Blenheim House.
In this room was the box in which two pills were afterwards found,
one of which was charged with aconitia. Were there other pills in
that box? It was known that Percy John kept medicine unknown
to everyone in the establishment, although it was against the rules
of the school; it being the duty of the master to administer all
medicine. The poor fellow was called ‘the swell pill taker,’ and
what was more likely than that, with the fascination of the new
capsules before him, he should have taken a pill for the heartburn
from which he was suffering. Did he do so? It was suggested that
these pills were some sent by the prisoner, but Mr. Bedbrook had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
exploded that idea. He swore that he thought he had destroyed
those referred to, but at any rate he had never given them back to
the prisoner. Now did these four or five pills, found on the table,
come from the box? Was there any evidence to show that the
boy did not carry pills in his pocket, and took one in consequence
of the heartburn? What did the prosecution mean? Did they
mean to say that there was a pill hidden in the capsule? If the
boy had thought of such a thing, would he not have asked Mr.
Bedbrook or Banbury whether they felt in a similar state? The
boy was in the possession of all his faculties when questioned, but
he did not say one word about the capsules.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Mr. Montagu Williams</i> then alluded to the admission of
Mr. Whalley that poisons were occasionally left in the house
after the chemical lectures, and to the probability that so
large a dose of aconitia as was assumed to have been given
would have acted sooner, as Dr. Stevenson admitted that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>21</sub> of
a grain might kill, and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>13</sub> would certainly have a fatal effect.
As for the medical note-book found in the prisoner’s possession,
he reminded the jury of Lord Campbell’s opinion in
Palmer’s case that nothing was more natural for a professional
man, and added, “It had no more bearing on the case
than if ‘Russell on Crimes’ had been found in his own
possession, on a charge of murder.”</p>

<p>On the proof of the purchase of aconitia at Allen’s, he
begged them to note, that on the 5th of December the police
commenced their enquiries, on the 6th the assistants at
Allen’s communicated with them, saying that the prisoner
had purchased atropia, and that it was not until after that
that they changed their opinion and were convinced that it
was aconitia. It was true that no entry of 3<i>d.</i> was found in
the cash book, but there was one of 8<i>d.</i>, and one of the
chemists had deposed that the wholesale price of atropia, to
a medical man, was 4<i>d.</i> a grain. But even if it was aconitia
that the prisoner then purchased, it was only natural for him
so to do, as he was suffering from rheumatism, of which it
was a cure. Again, though they knew where the larger
quinine powders, which were not poisoned, came from, it had
not been proved whence the smaller came, which it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
duty of the prosecution to have done. “Oddly enough, they
were tied up with a piece of string, a most unusual thing
coming from a chemist’s shop. They had traced twelve
quinine powders, but they had failed to trace the pills sent
from America which Mr. Bedbrook swore were not given
back to the deceased. He, Mr. Williams, could not say
where the smaller powders came from, nor where the pills
came from. The burden was not on him to do so, but on the
prosecution.”</p>

<p>Turning then to the evidence of the visit to the boy at
Shanklin, <i>Mr. Williams</i> said he would deal with that important
episode most successfully.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Albert Smith,” he said, “proved that on the 28th of August
he sold to prisoner three grains of atropia and one grain of aconitia,
charging 4<i>d.</i> per grain for the first and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per grain for the
last named. The suggestion on the part of the prosecution was
that in the month of August the assassin was at work and an
attempt was made on the life of the lad. In his judgment he
would make that melt into the thinnest of thin air. The 28th of
August was a Sunday, and on the previous day Mr. and Mrs. Chapman
and the boy arrived. At that time there were four persons
of the name of Lamson residing at the Isle of Wight&mdash;namely, the
prisoner’s father and mother, and himself and his wife. On the
27th of August they met the boy at the station, and went to Mrs.
Jolliffe’s lodgings, and here again there appeared a kindness and
solicitude for the deceased. The 28th was Sunday, and it was said
that he bought aconitia on that day, and that he was present on
the 29th, and in order to prove it it was said that a parcel was left
at the station in the name of Lamson, when there were four persons
on the island named Lamson. It was further said that the
deceased suffered from illness after taking something given to him
by the prisoner, and from that they assumed it was aconitia bought
at the shop of Mr. Smith that he had taken. The proof was all
the other way, as the symptoms upon which the prosecution relied
all through the case were not those which could be assigned to
aconitia, while he recovered within a few hours. Beyond that, it
was shown that he suffered from indigestion, especially by the fact
that although he dined at one o’clock on the day of his death, undigested
food was found in the vomit at nine o’clock at night. The
prisoner purchased the atropia and aconitia on the 28th of August,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
he was to leave for America on the 30th. This mixture was the
very thing he would have taken, and the very time he would
have bought it for the purpose of going on the voyage. The
dates exactly suited.”</p>

<p class="p1">Counsel’s explanation of the story told by the prisoner to
the witness Tulloch was ingenious.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The prisoner did not deny that he went down to Wimbledon
on December 2 with Tulloch, but if he contemplated assassination
then would he have been likely to have taken Tulloch with him?
That was an observation worthy of some note. He would try and
imagine a state of things to have existed, which was not impossible
but more than probable. It was admitted that upon the 2nd of
December the boy had been passing an examination. It was also
admitted the first thing the prisoner was greeted with on the 3rd
was, ‘I am glad you did not come yesterday.’ When he went
down on the 2nd what was more likely than that he met some one,
perhaps one of the boys, for it was a holiday, who told him it was
an examination day, and he therefore postponed his visit until the
next day? All the importance of this visit depended on the evidence
of a man who had altered his evidence as originally given,
and who, it was suggested, was on that night the worse for
liquor.”</p>

<p class="p1">With the remarks that the flight of the prisoner to Paris,
where he could have been arrested, and his return to England
and surrender to the police, were not the acts of a guilty man;
that, to obtain the pecuniary gain from the boy’s death, the
prisoner must have applied to the Court of Chancery, and if
there had been suspicion of foul play would find, instead of
receiving £1,500, the hangman’s halter round his neck, and a
fervid appeal on behalf of the wife who had stood by him in
Court, and his young child, <i>Mr. Montagu Williams</i> concluded
his minute and able survey of the case against his client.</p>

<p class="psh">THE REPLY.</p>

<p>The <i>Solicitor-General</i>, in his comparatively brief reply,
directed the attention of the jury to the following points.
He admitted that, in this case, they had to traverse a branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
of science but little known, that little was known of aconitia,
and everything speculation. He urged, however, that “that
argument, whilst fair, might be pressed too far, as then a
man desirous of taking life had only to use some poison but
little known, and then to ask that he should not be rendered
liable for the results of his crime. They found, no doubt,
from time to time, fresh materials used for the commission of
crime. If a man from his knowledge used a poison little
known and little used, still science, with unerring precision,
and working as fast as him, could bring the crime to light.”
The idea of death from natural causes had apparently been
abandoned by the prisoner’s counsel, so that it was impossible
to doubt that it was due to poison, and what that poison
was must rest on the evidence of the scientific witnesses,
“the first in their profession, of the highest skill, not called
in to prop up any theory, but to frame an independent
opinion. The presence of a third party would not have been
likely to assist the analysis, while on the other hand it might
have led to difficulty, and even mistake.” He disputed the
correctness of the quotation from Dr. Tidy. What he really
did say, was, “Experiments on animals may furnish us with
much useful information in cases of suspected poisoning, but
their value must not be over-estimated.” In this case they
were only used to strengthen the evidence from taste. “The
two tests must be used together. It was their combined
force that drove home to the mind the conviction that
Dr. Stevenson was right when he said that what he found in
the body was aconitia, and nothing but aconitia.” “As to the
cadaveric alkaloids, they had in evidence that they were only
produced along with putrefaction, and that their results on
animals were totally different from those of the extracts
from the boy’s body. Would they not say that Dr. Stevenson’s
experiments had been conducted in every way to exclude
error, and must they not, looking at the whole of the
scientific evidence, accept his judgment?”</p>

<p>As to the possibility of the boy himself obtaining this
poison, it was fenced round with such safeguards that not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
even a medical man, unless personally known, could obtain it
without a record being kept. His story about the visit to
Wimbledon was pure invention, and the explanation of it by
counsel ingenious, and no more. Falsehood seemed to have
been uttered by him at every turn. The taking Mr. Tulloch
with him was a mere blind: his return and surrender intended
to divert suspicion. Had he remained in France he
must have been arrested, and, if he had no money, he was
compelled to return to England.</p>

<p class="psh">THE JUDGE’S CHARGE.</p>

<p>In his charge to the jury, after pointing out that the two
points to which they had to direct their attention were
whether the boy died from poison or a natural disease, and
if by poison, whether it was administered to him by the
prisoner, Sir Henry Hawkins alluded to the alleged motive&mdash;the
prospect of an accession of fortune at the time when the
prisoner was in great pecuniary difficulties&mdash;and the fact that
until the day of his death the deceased, though a cripple, was
free from any mortal disease. Then, after referring to the
details of the prisoner’s visit to the boy on the 3rd of December,
the judge made the following remarks on the results of
the chemical analysis, and the comments of Mr. Williams on
them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The presence of morphia was, he said, accounted for, as it had
been injected beneath the skin for the purpose of allaying the pain.
With regard to the dark fluid in the stomach, it contained, according
to the evidence of Dr. Stevenson, traces of food, an apple,
and a raisin, and from it an alkaloidal extract was obtained; on
applying which to the tongue a slight taste of aconitia was produced.
The sensation extended to the lip, although the extract did
not touch it. The sensation was a burning, tingling, numbing one
difficult to define. Salivation and a desire to expectorate were produced&mdash;there
was a sensation at the back of the throat, a swelling
up: this was followed by a peculiar seared sensation of the
tongue, as though a hot iron had been passed over it or strong
caustic. Experiments were made with extracts from the liver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
spleen, and kidneys, from the dark fluid, and from the stomach
itself, and within nine minutes mice showed symptoms of
poisoning, and died in about twenty-two minutes afterwards. The
same sensation, in fact, was produced on the mice as had been produced
on his own tongue previously. In the urine there was a
taste of aconitia, which brought on a sickening and a burning
sensation. Mr. Montagu Williams had said that the experiments
upon mice were hardly a test as to what the effect of the extract
would be upon human beings. Granted; but they were about the
only tests that could properly be made, and they proved the
presence of aconitia. The drug, Dr. Stevenson said, produced a
sensation to the tongue and throat which was unmistakable, and its
property of killing was proved by its test upon the mice. Could
they believe Dr. Stevenson mistaken about that, it was asked&mdash;were
there not other vegetable alkaloids? There were; and Dr. Stevenson
said they all had peculiar tastes which differed from that of
aconitia. He further said that, having made himself acquainted
with between 50 and 80 vegetable alkaloids, aconitia differed in
taste from any of them. The learned Judge proceeded to read the
evidence given by Dr. Stevenson as to the action of the extract and
of prepared aconitia on the mice. Dr. Stevenson had minutely
examined the vomit to endeavour to trace some of the fibre of
monkshood from which aconite was extracted, and which, as was
known, had sometimes been mistaken for horse radish, but not a
particle could he find. But he obtained all the symptoms of
aconitia upon his tongue, and death resulted in 15½ minutes when
a small quantity was injected into the back of a mouse. He gave
it as his opinion that 1-13th of a grain was sufficient to kill, and
that he found enough aconitia in the stomach to cause the death
of two persons. Dr. Stevenson had been submitted to a severe
cross-examination, and it would be for the jury to say whether they
believed that he had really found aconitia. Mr. Williams had
said they were embarking in a new region in aconitia poisoning.
It might be they were not very learned in it, though they would
doubtless advance as fresh experiments were made and fresh tests
applied. At present it was true there was no chemical test. That
was admitted. Mr. Williams, in the course of his cross-examination,
had spoken of phosphoric acid, but Dr. Stevenson said that
only applied to foreign aconitia, and not to Morson’s English preparation.
They had before them the explanation of Dr. Stevenson.
It stood for what it was worth, and it was for them to say if he
was correct, after the experiments he had made, in saying that he
had found aconitia. Dr. Stevenson had explained the only tests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
physiological and otherwise, to trace aconitia, and had formed his
opinion that death arose from that substance. With reference to
cadaveric alkaloids, Dr. Stevenson did not admit that poisonous
cadaveric alkaloids were to be found in the human body. He did
not dispute there were cadaveric alkaloids, but he disputed their
being poisonous. He did not say they were not so; it was still an
open question. The result of the 22 experiments he had made by
tasting cadaveric alkaloids never gave him any taste like aconitia,
and in only one case did death ensue to a mouse experimented
upon, which was where the little animal’s spine was injured by the
needle used for the injection. Another circumstance spoken to by
Dr. Dupré was that no trace of quinine was found in the vomit,
but that might be due to the fact that a portion of the vomit was
thrown away. Upon the testimony as to the cause of death the
prosecution said that there was no possibility of accounting for
death by natural causes, and it was for the jury to say whether
the death was from aconitia.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then going through the evidence of the prisoner’s pecuniary
embarrassments, he alluded to the sending of the pills
from America as showing that if he had entertained the
design of poisoning the boy, he had done so long before the
fatal act.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Mischief, it was held, had been concocted long before the lad
died. Prisoner went to America in the early part of 1881, and
returned about the 2nd July, and whilst there, as Mr. Bedbrook
had said, he sent over a box of pills, saying that he had found
them to be useful in the complaint under which the boy suffered.
The boy had one pill given to him, and Mr. Bedbrook believed
that as he did not like it he took the box and threw the remainder
away. In the month of August aconitia was, it was said, administered
to the boy whilst at Shanklin, and that it came from powders
contained in a box. These circumstances did not lead to
death, but they indicated, as was contended, the desire of the
prisoner to do mischief to the unfortunate boy. It was a question
certainly whether the pills given were the same as those which the
prisoner sent over from America, and which Mr. Bedbrook believed
he had thrown away. In the bedroom at Wimbledon was found a
box of quinine powders&mdash;six large and fourteen small ones. Eleven
of the small ones were of pure quinine, but three of them were
more or less mixed with aconitia. Dr. Stevenson said that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
of the powders&mdash;No. 16&mdash;contained 1 and eight-tenths of a grain,
and that the proportion of quinine to aconitia in it was as 83 to 96.
Dr. Stevenson tested it, and the sensation upon his tongue lasted
three hours. One-fiftieth part of a grain was tried on a mouse,
and it was dead in six minutes and a half afterwards. They would
judge how fatal a quantity was in the powder if they bore in mind
what they had been told as to the fatality of 1-13th part of a grain.
In Nos. 17 and 19 there was some trace of aconitia, but in neither
of them anything like the quantity in No. 16. The box in which
those powders were found had been in common use, and one of the
boys had actually taken one of them. Anybody, of course, might
have taken one of the eleven pure powders, and the lad himself&mdash;with
the exception of once, at Shanklin&mdash;had never shown any
symptoms that might be considered anything like aconitia poisoning.
No doubt three of the powders did contain aconitia in
considerable quantities, and they had to consider how did the
aconitia come into them? Among other things found in the boy’s
box were two pills in a tin pill-box. A tin pill-box, it was suggested,
was sent over from America. Mr. Williams said that
Mr. Bedbrook stated he had destroyed them, but the fact remained
that the box with the two pills&mdash;one of which was poisoned&mdash;were
found in the play-box. It was true there was no evidence that the
box was the same, but Mr. Bedbrook said it resembled that which
he received from America, but which he said he thought he had
destroyed.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Pardon me, my Lord, but Mr. Bedbrook, I
think, never said he destroyed the box; he said he had destroyed
the pills.”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“ I think he said he threw them away.” His Lordship
referred to his notes, and said that Mr. Bedbrook in his
evidence stated that he took the box downstairs, and was under
the impression he threw it away. When he saw the box, however,
it appeared to him exactly like that which came from America,
and the pills were also exactly like them.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Williams.</i>&mdash;“Mr. Bedbrook said he never gave the pills back
to the deceased boy.”</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“That is so. He said he was under the impression
he had thrown them away. It was said that the boy
could not get aconitia himself, but though he could not do so
the prisoner could. Next they heard what had occurred at
Shanklin in October, 1881. The prisoner was going to America,
and sailed on the 30th August. On the 27th of that month Mr.
and Mrs. Chapman, with the boy, went to Shanklin, and found on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
the platform to meet them the prisoner and his wife. They had
some conversation, and prisoner promised to call on Monday, 29th,
to say ‘Good-bye.’ On the night of Sunday, the 28th, they had
it on the testimony of Mr. Smith, a chemist, that the prisoner
called on him and bought, amongst other things, three grains of
atropia and one grain of aconitia. It was endeavoured to be
shown on the part of the prosecution that he had called pursuant
to his promise on the 29th, and in evidence of that it was sought
to produce the cloak-room book of the railway station. On the
29th, however, the boy was unquestionably unwell. It was clear
that on the 27th the prisoner saw him, and said he would call
again on the Monday, but there was no direct evidence that he
did, although he bought aconitia on the 28th, which Mr. Williams
said might have been bought with an innocent motive, as the
prisoner at the time was suffering from neuralgia.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Reviewing then the prisoner’s conduct in London, and the
story invented by him about his pretended visit to the boy on
the 2nd of December, “which,” he said, “did not amount to
much, but must be taken, with the other circumstances of
the case, to show that the prisoner’s word was not to be relied
on,” the learned judge then referred to the incidents of the fatal
night. As to the two boxes of capsules, he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The prosecution suggested that these two boxes of capsules
were brought by the prisoner, but they did not suggest there was
poison in any of them. They were clearly innocent capsules, as
two of them did no harm either to Mr. Bedbrook or to the lad
Banbury, each of whom swallowed one. What the prosecution
suggested, however, was that whilst Mr. Bedbrook was examining
the capsule he had taken from the box, the prisoner took another,
in which there was aconitia, from another box, and that over that
aconitia he put in the sugar, and then administered it to the boy.
That was the suggestion made. They asked for those facts to be
put together&mdash;the boy was in as good health as he ordinarily was,
in as good spirits as usual, having neither eaten nor partaken of
anything in which there was a suggestion of poison during the day,
and yet within half-an-hour, or less, of seeing the prisoner and
swallowing the capsule he was taken ill. The cake, the sweets,
and the capsule were all three given him by the prisoner, and
within a short time he showed the first symptoms described,
viz., heartburn, which was followed rapidly by painful sensations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
and the contraction of the throat, retching, vomiting, agony, and
raving to the time of death. On these facts the prosecution asked
them to come to the conclusion that he not only died by aconitia,
but by aconitia administered to him by the prisoner, it being clear
that no other person administered anything to him during the prisoner’s
visit. The prosecution contended farther that they had
shown the prisoner to be possessed of aconitia, upon the evidence
of two purchases of aconitia by him, one from the chemist at
Ventnor on the 28th August, and the other about the 20th
November at Allen and Hanbury’s, in Plough Court.</p>

<p class="p1">Then again placing before the jury the two questions he
had referred to in the opening of his charge, and warning
them not to allow sympathy either for the poor boy or the
prisoner to bias their decision, Sir Henry Hawkins left the
case in their hands.</p>

<p>In less than three-quarters of an hour the jury returned a
verdict of “Guilty.” When called upon as usual to say why
judgment should not be passed upon him, the prisoner, standing
with arms folded, in a loud voice, “protested his innocence
before God,” and with very few words, the learned
judge pronounced sentence of death.</p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF LAMSON’S STATE OF MIND.</p>

<p>Within a short time after the conviction of the prisoner,
Mr. Lowell, the American Minister, by the instruction of
President Arthur, requested the Home Secretary to suspend
the execution, on the faith of a statement from the United
States Attorney-General that evidence bearing on the state of
mind of the prisoner, was preparing in America, and would
be shortly forwarded to England. To this novel application
Sir William Harcourt acceded, in courtesy to the applicant.
The promised affidavits arrived, and were considered by the
Home Secretary as insufficient. Again a further application
for delay was made, on the promise of further evidence, and
acceded to for the term of a fortnight, with clear notice to
Lamson that if the promised affidavits were not more satisfactory
than the preceding ones, the sentence would be carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
out. Such they proved in the opinion of Sir William Harcourt,
and Lamson was at length executed on the 28th of April.</p>

<p>The proffered evidence not only covered the whole of Lamson’s
life from the days of his medical pupilage at Paris till
his trial, but sought to establish “a marked hereditary
tendency to insanity,” from the fact that his grandmother had
been in the New York Bloomingdale Asylum from the age of
seventy-six till her death four years after, and had been previously
suffering from “senile dementia,” the apparent cause
of which was entered in the Hospital Register as “predisposing;”&mdash;that
her brother, a sea captain, at the age of eighty,
was in the same asylum, having been suffering for two years
from “dementia,” also entered as “predisposing;” and that her
daughter, a Mrs. McGregor, at the age of thirty-one, was a
patient until her death about three years after&mdash;her mania
“puerperal,” and also entered as “predisposing.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> No
evidence, however, was offered of the mental condition of any
less remote ancestors.</p>

<p>As a <i>Medical Student</i> in Paris in 1869-70, Lamson is
described as suffering from cerebral anæmia with a tendency
to melancholia, given to imaginary complaints about the surgical
theatre, apt to take offence, with a passion for chemical
experiments of a morbid character, generally genial in manner,
and taciturn of speech. When employed in the American
Ambulance during the siege of Paris in 1870-71, “his
behaviour was so wild, erratic, and bad, that his associate
aids were not prepared to say whether it was that of an idiot
or the result of special wickedness&mdash;his mind so disordered
that he could not be entrusted to administer medicines, as to
the effects of which he seemed to be utterly destitute of judgment
and common sense&mdash;just as likely to give a large and
dangerous dose as a smaller and safe one, no matter how
particularly instructed, and seemed to be utterly reckless of
results.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>From this date to the year 1877, no evidence was offered of
his conduct or state of mind. In that year he acted as a
surgeon for the Red Cross Society at Bucharest, in the Servian
War. Whilst there “he exhibited a mania for the
administration of aconitia in almost every case, using it in
season and out of season, and in such quantities as to alarm
the medical staff and render his recall to England necessary.
Here, too, he appears to have commenced on himself the
extravagant use of hypodermic injections of morphia, to
which he subsequently became so notoriously addicted, on
the plea that he was in constant pain and misery,” and to
have been constantly under the influence of some anæsthetic.
He was also habitually incoherent and inconsistent in his way
of talking, boasting of adventures in the American Civil War,
when he could have been only twelve years of age. His father,
who was with him, seemed to keep a constant watch over his
son, and frequently expressed his wish that some other surgeon
should be associated with him.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>In 1879 Lamson purchased a medical practice at Bournemouth,
and during the two years that he remained there,
according to the testimony of friends and servants, behaved in
a most erratic and strange manner. Whilst there his habit of
injecting morphia under his skin increased in a most extraordinary
degree, one witness saying that “he was hardly ever
in his company for more than an hour that he did not use the
hypodermic syringe.” When visiting patients he seemed not
to know why he had come, or what he ought to do, behaving
so strangely that his services were eventually dispensed with.
His habit of telling extravagant stories grew rapidly upon
him. His eyes had a fitful and nervous look as if afraid of
phantoms. He seemed to be perpetually trying to look sane,
and the witness (Warren, an artist) who spoke to these symptoms
said “he had frequently seen him walking along quickly,
his head hanging down, when he would stop suddenly, turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
back, and branch off in some other direction, crossing backwards
and forwards over the road without rhyme or reason.”
Mr. Radcliffe Hall, of Welbeck-street, to whom Lamson had
made in writing a perfectly baseless statement about Mrs.
Hall’s antecedents, and afterwards could remember nothing
about it, had seen him inject morphia twenty times a day.
His servants thought him mad, and humoured him accordingly,
and the patients who attended at the dispensary which
with another medical man he managed, with only one or two
exceptions, refused to be attended by him.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>From April to May, 1881, Lamson was staying at Rouse’s
Point, New York, with the Rev. Irving McElroy, the rector
of Christ Church, during which period his habit of injecting
morphia was continued, and, according to the testimony of
the rector and his wife, Dr. Winston, the Medical Director of
the New York Mutual Life Assurance Company, Dr. Murray,
Physician of Rouse’s Point, Dr. Hall, and others who knew
him, it was seriously affecting his brain. On one occasion he
was found in the public street with no coat on, and his left
arm bared. He had a syringe in one hand, and with the
thumb of the other was pressing down the place where the
injection had been made.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> At his friend’s house he passed
the greater part of the day on the lounge, either dozing or
attempting to read. He was then using a mixture apparently
of morphia and atropine, but told them he preferred aconitine,
but could not procure it in that section of the county. To
one of the witnesses he admitted that his whole existence
depended on the constant use of morphia. The marks of
these repeated injections were detected by Dr. Williamson of
Edinburgh whom Lamson consulted in New York in October,
1881, who marked the serious change that had taken place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
his health, and urged his discontinuance of this baneful practice.
Dr. Hall considered Lamson “not a perfectly sane
man,” Dr. Winston considered that he “had become a helpless
victim of the habit (of injecting morphia) which had
seriously impaired his mental powers and destroyed his moral
responsibility,” and in Dr. Murray’s opinion “he was utterly
irresponsible for his acts.” It is admitted, however, that at
intervals his conversation was perfectly clear and lucid, and
to none of the medical men appears to have been put the
legal test question, “did he know the difference between right
and wrong, at the time wherein he committed the crime?”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, we are offered testimony as to the condition of
Lamson’s mind for a few days immediately preceding the fatal
occurrence, and that of his father and wife as to his strange
conduct for some time previous. All, however, that this
evidence amounts to is, that he was so strange and extravagant
in his manner and conduct, that he was spoken of by friends
and acquaintance as a lunatic, that “for a year past his wife’s
fears and anxieties had been greatly and increasingly aroused
for the soundness of his mind&mdash;that his brain, predisposed to
weakness, or constitutionally liable to disturbance, was unsettled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
by ill-health and trouble, and its disease aggravated by
the use of morphia.” His father spoke to the wild and
fanciful delusions in which his son indulged&mdash;the whole
being myths, and believed “that for at least eighteen months
he had been in an unsound state of mind, steadily increasing
in its character and blinding him to the natural and inevitable
effects of his acts; and that the balance of his mind had been
quite destroyed.” His solicitor deposed that “he could
obtain no assistance from him in the preparation of his defence&mdash;that
he appeared to have no memory and to be incapable
of appreciating the bearing of any of the facts of his case, or
the gravity of his position; that he laboured under extravagant
hallucination, whilst his statements were either incoherent,
inconsistent, or manifestly the creations of a disordered
brain.”</p>

<p>Three medical men of experience speak to the effects almost
certain to be produced by such an habitually excessive use of
morphia or opium, as that of which Dr. Lamson was the
victim. Dr. Coghill, of the Ventnor Consumptive Hospital,
and for eight years municipal medical officer and consulting
physician to a general hospital in China, where he had
unusual facilities for becoming familiar with the effects of
opium smoking and eating, has no hesitation in saying that
“anyone in the habit of using opium to such an extent would
be incapable of self-control, and have his moral senses and
powers of judgment deteriorated to a degree rendering him
incapable of resisting morbid influences.” Dr. H. H. Kane,
of Fort Washington, New York, who had written on the
effects of “these drugs that enslave,” and on the “Hypodermic
Injection of Morphia,” and was then in charge of a
hospital devoted to the treatment of opium smokers and eaters
and the like habits, admits that “as regards the question of
insanity from the habitual use of opium or its alkaloids, more
especially morphia, but little definite is known. Insane
Asylum reports,” he adds, “record every year from six to
eight cases of insanity attributed to the prolonged use of
opiates; and physicians in general practice recognise it as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
rare, though well-established, form of insanity. A person
with an hereditary tendency to insanity, or with a mind weakened
from any combination of circumstances, or from bodily
disease, using this drug in large amount for a considerable
time, could hardly escape some unsettling of his mental and
moral powers. Actual mania, melancholia, and dementia are
probably rare, but have undoubtedly occurred from this cause.
Of all the forms of the opium habit that by hypodermic
injection, as a rule, works the most harm in the shortest
time.”</p>

<p>Dr. R. M. Miller, of Norwood, who saw Lamson professionally
in July, 1881, when his friends were alarmed at his
condition, is of opinion “that morphia and atropia, taken in
such quantities, would gradually ruin the powers of the nervous
system and also the powers of self-control.”</p>

<p>Such is the substance of the testimony of the cloud of witnesses
proffered in support of the appeal for a scientific
investigation into the mental state of Lamson at the time
when he committed the act for which he was arraigned. To
what does it amount? Even if it goes beyond proof that he
was occasionally nervous, disconnected in his ideas, aimlessly
untruthful, and with a hobby for the administration of aconitia
as a panacea for all diseases, and a loss of vital nerve and
energy, there is no evidence to suggest that these eccentricities
were dangerous or ever assumed the form of homicidal
mania. “If,” said a contemporary writer, “Lamson could
appreciate the pecuniary benefit he would derive from Percy
John’s death&mdash;and why else should he have selected his
victim?&mdash;he could realise the wickedness of his act. A
symptom of dangerous madness is that it acts without apparent
motive&mdash;the immediate circumstances of the murder
pointed to the exercise of a crafty deliberation, which, though
not in itself inconsistent with homicidal mania, was not as
aimless as homicidal mania.” Is it not a parallel case to that
of Dove, a weak and erratic mind, in that case further
weakened and unhinged by drink, in this case by the vicious
use of morphia? Are not the words of Baron Bramwell in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
Dove’s case strictly applicable to this? “The rules of law,”
said that judge, “are that it must be clearly proved that, at
the time of committing the act, the party accused was labouring
under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind,
as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was
doing; and if he did know it, that he did not know he was
doing wrong.” Until the law is altered it is impossible to
doubt that the Home Secretary was right, “that he could
find in the affidavits and statutory declarations no sufficient
grounds for advising an interference with the sentence of the
law.”</p>

<p class="pch">ACONITE: ACONITIA OR ACONITINE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name aconite is applied to a great number of plants
belonging to the natural order Ranunculaceæ. Two species
only need be noticed here, <i>Aconitum napellus</i> and <i>A. ferox</i>.
The former is the well-known “monkshood,” “wolfsbane,”
or “blue rocket,” a very beautiful but exceedingly poisonous
plant, commonly cultivated in English gardens. This very
variable and widely diffused species is found in the mountainous
districts of the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere: it occurs in the Alps up to an altitude of more
than 6,000 feet, in the Pyrenees, and in the mountain ranges
of Germany and Austria. It is also met with in Sweden,
Denmark, Siberia, and in the mountainous districts on the
Pacific coast of North America.</p>

<p><i>Aconitum ferox</i>, Nepaul aconite &mdash;“Bikh”), is a native of
the subalpine Himalayas, occurring, together with A. napellus
and several other poisonous species, at an elevation of 10,000
to 14,000 feet.</p>

<p>The most recent researches of Dr. C. R. Alder Wright and
others have shown that Aconitum napellus chiefly owes its
poisonous properties to the base <i>aconitia</i>, or <i>aconitine</i> (also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>called <i>aconitina</i>), C<sub>33</sub> H<sub>43</sub> NO<sub>12</sub>, a highly active crystallizable
alkaloid furnishing readily crystallizable salts. This base
constitutes about one-half of the total quantity of alkaloids
present in the root, and is considered to be in combination
with <i>aconitic acid</i>, H<sub>3</sub> C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>3</sub> O<sub>6</sub>. There is also present, but
in much smaller quantity (about 10 per cent. of the total
bases present&mdash;Wright), another physiologically active crystallizable
alkaloid, <i>pseudaconitia</i>, C<sub>36</sub> H<sub>49</sub> NO<sub>12</sub>, similar in many
respects to aconitia (especially in its effects upon the animal
system), but not so readily yielding crystallizable salts. The
roots of A. napellus contain, in addition to aconitia and pseudaconitia,
a considerable quantity of a third base, comparatively
inert, apparently amorphous, yielding non-crystallizable salts,
and containing a higher percentage of carbon than either
aconitia or pseudaconitia.</p>

<p>Aconitum ferox contains as its active principle <i>pseudaconitia</i>,
or <i>nepaline</i>, associated with a comparatively small quantity
of aconitia: there is present in addition a non-crystallizable
alkaloid containing more carbon than either of the
other bases, but apparently not identical with the analogous
body from A. napellus.</p>

<p>The plants have been stated to contain, besides the bases
already named, various other alkaloids, such as “napel-line,”
“acolyctine,” “lycoctonine,” &amp;c., but there is no doubt that
these substances are merely products of the decomposition of
aconitia and pseudaconitia, formed during the process of
extraction. Aconitia and pseudaconitia are very easily decomposed;
thus, when heated with water in a sealed tube, the
former is converted into benzoic acid and a fresh alkaloid,
<i>aconine</i>, C<sub>26</sub> H<sub>39</sub> NO<sub>11</sub>, the reaction being represented by the
following equation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Aconine is doubtless identical with Hübschmann’s “napel-line,”
discovered by him in commercial aconitia, and afterwards
proved to be the same as the “acolyctine” which he
had previously obtained. Pseudaconine is apparently the
base “lycoctonine” of the same chemist.</p>

<p>Commercial aconitia is a mixture of aconitia and pseudaconitia
with variable quantities of their decomposition-products,
aconine and pseudaconine, and of the amorphous
unnamed alkaloids above referred to (Wright and others;
Year-Book of Pharmacy, 1877, <i>et seq.</i>). In commercial aconitia
prepared from Aconitum napellus (<i>German aconitia</i>),
<i>aconitia</i> predominates: <i>English aconitia</i> is chiefly if not entirely
prepared from A. ferox, and in it <i>pseudaconitia</i> is the
prevailing active base.</p>

<p>All parts of the plants (A. napellus and A. ferox) are
poisonous, the active principles being contained in the seeds,
roots, leaves and flowering tops. The roots are chiefly used
for the extraction of the alkaloids, of which the proportions
yielded are very variable and depend on the time when the
roots are collected. An ounce of the fresh root of A. napellus
contains, according to Woodman and Tidy, from ¼ to ¾ of a
grain of aconitia, while a pound of the dried root furnishes
from 12 to 36 grains, or 0·1 to 0·2 per cent. “The average
produce of the root, <i>collected after flowering</i> and fresh, is 8·58
grains of aconitia in the pound; of the same dried, 35·72
grains. But if collected before flowering, the yield is only
3·5 grains per pound in the fresh, and 12·13 in the dried root
(Herapath). These results are the average of several experiments....
The root of A. ferox contains about three
times as much alkaloid as that of the English plant” (Royle’s
Mat. Med.). According to Wright and Rennie (Year-Book of
Pharm., 1880, 458), the percentage of total bases yielded by
the root of A. napellus, calculated on the dry substance,
amounted to ·07 per cent., equivalent to about ·05 per cent,
of total alkaloids in the dry herb. Two-fifths of the total
alkaloid consisted of pure crystallized aconitia.</p>

<p>Commercial aconitia or aconitine is generally met with as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
white amorphous powder, but is occasionally crystalline. It
dissolves in 150 parts of cold and 50 parts of hot water, and
is also soluble in alcohol, benzole, and chloroform: it is inodorous,
possesses an acrid taste (W. and T., For. Med.,
p. 392), and is strongly alkaline to test-paper. It generally
fuses below 100° C. (60° C., W. and T.), and gives an amorphous
sublimate above 150° C. (<i>pure</i> aconitia fuses at 183°-184°
C.: <i>pure</i> pseudaconitia melts at 104°-105° C.): when
strongly heated with free access of air, it burns with a yellow,
smoky flame, leaving no residue. Crystallized samples of
commercial aconitia are the purest. Amorphous aconitia,
and particularly that prepared in Germany, is very impure,
being admixed with considerable quantities of comparatively
inert bases. The use of such a preparation should be avoided,
as being liable to give rise to a false idea as to the proper
dose of the pure alkaloid (Royle’s Mat. Med., 1876, p. 773).
Morson’s “English aconitine” (<i>pseudaconitia</i>) is much more
powerful than the French and German products, which are
mostly prepared from A. napellus, and consist mainly of
aconitia.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Aconitia and pseudaconitia differ from one another in their
molecular weights and melting-points; they also furnish different
decomposition-products: aconitia readily furnishes well-crystallized
salts, while the salts of pseudaconitia are usually
obtained amorphous; and finally, crystallized aconitia is
anhydrous, while pseudaconitia crystallizes with one atom
of water.</p>

<p>The two bases are similar as regards their physiological
action (pseudaconitia is perhaps somewhat more powerfully
active than aconitia), and general behaviour with reagents.</p>

<p>The characters and physiological action of commercial
aconitia <i>vary greatly</i>, as might be expected from the ununiformity
of its composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">SEPARATION AND TESTS.</p>

<p>For the extraction and separation of aconitia from anima
matters, the modification of Stas’s general method, described
on page 5 (Chap. I.), may be employed. The alkaloids of
aconite being, as has been already shown, very liable to decomposition,
great care must be taken, during the extraction with
alcohol and subsequent evaporation of the extracts, that the
temperature does not rise above 50° C.: the use of mineral
acids should also be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;1. The residue of aconitia or pseudaconitia, obtained
on spontaneous evaporation of the anhydrous chloroform
solution, will generally be found to be more or less
crystalline, when examined under the microscope.</p>

<p>2. The Taste Test.&mdash;A minute portion of the residue,
either alone or dissolved in a small quantity of water acidulated
with acetic acid, should be rubbed with the finger on
the lips and gums, or cautiously applied to the tip of the
tongue. If aconitia or pseudaconitia be present, a peculiar
tingling and numbness will be quickly experienced in and
around the parts to which the alkaloidal extract has been
applied: salivation, with a desire to expectorate, and a sense
of swelling at the back of the throat, are also frequently
noticed. The effects, or some of them, usually last from
three to six hours, or even longer. <i>This action is peculiar to
aconite; the test, therefore, is of the utmost value, and one
which must never be omitted.</i></p>

<p>3. The Physiological Test.&mdash;Inject a small quantity of the
alkaloidal extract, dissolved in a little water acidulated with
acetic acid, into the back of a mouse or other small animal.
In the event of aconitia being present, characteristic symptoms
of aconite poisoning are manifested in a few minutes, and the
death of the animal rapidly ensues. Among the chief symptoms
observed by Dr. Fleming, in some experiments upon
animals, made in 1844, were “weakness of the limbs, staggering,
a gradually increasing paralysis of the voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
muscles, loss or diminution of sight, slowness of pulse, difficulty
of breathing, occasional convulsive movements, in two cases
opisthotonos, contracted pupils, but often dilating two or
three minutes before death, and death by asphyxia.” (Woodman
and Tidy’s For. Med., p. 394). This test is also a very
important one.</p>

<p>4. Chemical Tests.&mdash;Solutions of salts of aconitia and
pseudaconitia are precipitated by most of the general reagents
for alkaloids, such as Mayer’s reagent, tannic acid, potassium
tri-iodide, phosphomolybdic acid, &amp;c. Platinic chloride,
picric or carbazotic acid, and auric chloride, however, do <i>not</i>
give precipitates, except in <i>concentrated</i> solutions. Among
the special tests for aconitia and pseudaconitia which have
been described, the following may be mentioned. (A) With
<i>sulphuric acid</i>, no change takes place in the cold, but on
warming, a pale yellow, deepening into brown, and finally
changing into violet-red, is observed. This reaction varies
very greatly with different samples of aconitia, and little or
no reliance can be placed upon it as a toxicological test.
(B) With <i>sulphuric acid</i> and a drop of <i>saturated solution of
sugar</i>, a fine rose-red colour, passing into dingy brown, has
been obtained. Experience, however, has not shown this
test to be of any especial value. (C) If cautiously heated for
ten or fifteen minutes on the water-bath with a few drops of
<i>syrupy phosphoric acid</i>, aconitia is said to yield a violet or
blue colour. This reaction is uncertain and therefore useless:
it may be obtained with impure samples, while pure aconitia
and pseudaconitia fail to give it. Mr. T. B. Groves (Year-Book
of Pharmacy, 1873) says:&mdash;“The colour reactions of
these alkaloids may be dismissed in a word. There are
‘none.’ As for the phosphoric acid reaction producing a
blue colour, I have never succeeded in obtaining it. It is
probably due to some accidental impurity, and I believe Dr.
Flückiger has arrived at the same conclusion.”</p>

<p>Hence, as there are no reliable, characteristic, and distinctive
chemical tests for aconitia, its presence or absence must be
judged chiefly from the results of the tests of taste and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
physiological action on small animals. <i>A substance, previously
proved to be an alkaloid by its yielding precipitates with
most of the general reagents for alkaloids, and which, when
applied to the tongue and injected under the skin of a small
animal, produces the effects already described, is absolutely
certain to be aconitia.</i></p>

<p class="psh">HISTORY, PREPARATIONS, AND DOSES.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The <i>Ἀκόνιτον</i> of the Greeks and Aconitum of the
Romans are believed to refer to the genus Aconitum, if not
actually to A. napellus. The ancients were well acquainted
with the poisonous properties of aconite, which has been
widely used as an arrow-poison. It was employed by the
ancient Chinese, and is still in requisition among the less
civilised hill tribes of India.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Something similar was in use
among the aborigines of ancient Gaul. In a Welsh MS. of
the 13th century, aconite was pointed out as one of the plants
which every physician was to grow. The root and the herb
are met with in the German pharmaceutical tariff of the 17th
century. Störck, of Vienna, introduced aconite into regular
practice about the year 1762 (Flückiger and Hanbury;
“Pharmacographia,” 1879).</p>

<p><i>Preparations and Medicinal Doses,</i>&mdash;Aconite leaves
(Aconiti Folia) and root (Aconiti Radix) are officinal in the
British Pharmacopœia, and the plants from which they are
obtained (A. napellus) are cultivated in Britain (Squire’s Companion
to the B. P., 1868). The chief preparations are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Aconitia</i>, B. P.&mdash;Aconitine. Not for internal use,
according to the Pharmacopœia. It is, however, occasionally
prescribed in very minute doses (<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>/<sub>400</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub> of a grain by the
mouth: not more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>200</sub> of a grain, subcutaneously injected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
Royle’s Materia Medica). Dr. J. Harley has given
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>200</sub> of a grain, once a day, in fevers.</p>

<p>2. <i>Unguentum Aconitiæ</i>, <i>B. P.</i>&mdash;Ointment of aconitia.
Prepared with lard. Strength, 8 grains of aconitia to the
ounce (= 1·66 per cent.). For external application in painful
nervous affections, neuralgia, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. <i>Linimentum Aconiti</i>, <i>B. P.</i>&mdash;Useful for external application
in neuralgia or lumbago. May contain about 2 per cent.
of aconitia (Blyth).</p>

<p>4. <i>Extractum Aconiti</i>, <i>B. P.</i>&mdash;Prepared from the leaves
and flowering tops. Dose, 1 to 2 grains.</p>

<p>5. <i>Tinctura Aconiti</i>, <i>B. P.</i>&mdash;Dose, 5 to 10 minims, twice
or thrice a day (Squire); 5 to 15 minims, and only to be
gradually if at all increased (Royle); never to exceed 5 minims
(Farquharson’s Therapeutics).<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>6. <i>Fleming’s Tincture of Aconite</i> is not officinal; it is nearly
four times stronger than the B. P. tincture, and must on no
account be given in the above doses (Royle).</p>

<p>7. <i>Liston’s Strong Tincture.</i>&mdash;Not officinal.</p>

<p>8. <i>Aconiti Succus.</i>&mdash;The expressed juice. Not officinal.
Dose, 15 to 20 minims (Squire’s Comp. to the B. P.).</p>

<p>9. <i>Extractum Aconiti Rad.</i>&mdash;Not officinal. Prepared with
alcohol. Dose, half a grain.</p>

<p><i>Fatal Dose of Aconitia.</i>&mdash;Smallest: in one case <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub> of a
grain nearly proved fatal (Pereira). The tenth and even
twentieth of a grain are believed to have caused death (Headland;
Herapath). The average quantity for an adult is probably
between <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> of a grain. One drachm of the root,
four grains of the alcoholic extract, and one drachm of the
tincture have proved fatal.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Numerous well-authenticated
cases are on record of aconite root being scraped and eaten at
table, in mistake for horseradish, with very serious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
even fatal results.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> (See Guy and Ferrier’s For. Med.,
p. 617.)</p>

<p><i>Fatal Period.</i>&mdash;The shortest time in which death has been
known to occur is 1¼ hour: the longest, 20 hours: average,
less than 4 hours (Guy and Ferrier). A case is mentioned in
Woodman and Tidy’s Forensic Medicine, however, in which
death occurred in 20 <i>minutes</i>. “The symptoms usually make
their appearance in from a few minutes to one or two hours;
whilst death usually takes place within three or four hours”
(W. and T., p. 393).</p>

<p class="psh">PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.</p>

<p>Aconite produces, locally applied, a tingling sensation, followed
by numbness, and the earliest symptom of poisoning by
aconite, when any one of its preparations has been taken by
the mouth, is tingling, followed by numbness and anæsthesia
of the lips and throat, afterwards becoming general. Vomiting
occurs frequently, but not universally: purging is not
nearly so frequent (W. and T.). The intellectual faculties
are usually unaffected, but in some cases there is stupor.
Aconite paralyses both the reflex and motor activity of the
spinal cord, hence there is an almost total loss of muscular
power. The respiratory centre is eventually paralysed, so
that death may result from suffocation (Farquharson). The
heart’s action becomes feeble and irregular; its rapidity is
first diminished, then increased. The face is pale, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
body bathed in a clammy sweat: the pupils “are at first contracted,
and afterwards dilated shortly before death.” The
respiration becomes slower, then irregular, and death generally
results from its cessation (<i>asphyxia</i>).</p>

<p>In cases of poisoning by aconite, death may be caused by
(1) <i>asphyxia</i>, (2) <i>shock</i>, or (3) <i>syncope</i>.</p>

<p>The following symptoms were noted in the case of a cat, to
which one-tenth of a grain of Morson’s English aconitia
(= pseudaconitia, or nepaline) was administered:&mdash;stertorous
and difficult breathing, staggering motions, convulsions
(always contracting, never stretching like strychnia), vomiting,
foaming at the mouth, moans and spasmodic cries,
violent struggles for breath; the body fell over on one side,
the limbs were stretched forward and worked spasmodically,
but never stiffened. Attacks intermittent, with peaceful
intervals. Involuntary defecation; retching (the stomach
had already emptied itself), prolonged low moans, gasps for
breath, abdominal rumblings, insensibility for two hours with
occasional twitching, moans and cries. Eyes wide open,
<i>pupils not contracted</i>. Finally, after 2½ hours, a few slight
struggles, a convulsive gasp, and death. Stiffening very
slow. Tongue protruded beyond the teeth.</p>

<p>Twelve hours after death, the rigidity was very strong. A
post-mortem examination was then made, with the following
results. Pupils dilated. Intestines and other organs normal,
not congested: lungs collapsed and congested: heart very
much venously congested. Blood not more fluid than usual.
Larynx filled with frothy mucus. Brain congested.</p>

<p>On analysis of the stomach and other organs an alkaloidal
extract was obtained, which, when submitted to the taste test,
produced all the effects characteristic of aconitia. It is worthy
of remark that the colour-tests completely failed.</p>

<p><i>Treatment and antidotes.</i>&mdash;“Emetics, stimulants internal
and external” (Squire’s Comp. B. P.). No chemical antidote
is known: animal charcoal has been recommended, but its
efficacy is doubtful. A mustard emetic should be applied,
followed by the stomach-pump. “In the latter stages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
depletion from a jugular vein to relieve the distension of the
right heart, accompanied by the most persevering efforts to
promote the expansion of the chest.” Gentle magneto-electric
currents down the back of the neck and around the
margin of the ribs, to excite contractions of the diaphragm,
accompanied by rhythmical abductions of the upper extremities,
should be employed. If there is yet a capability of
swallowing, brandy and ammonia should be given (Royle’s
Mat. Med.).</p>

<p class="psh"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span></p>

<p>Pure aconitia is perhaps the most deadly poison with which
we are at present acquainted, and all the preparations of
aconite are excessively poisonous. Unless employed with
extreme caution they are very dangerous, and should on no
account be used, even for external application, except with
the advice of, or by a medical man.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The urgent necessity for an alteration in the law at present
relating to the sale of poisons, and for the introduction of a
clause placing some restrictions on the sale of patent medicines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
containing poisons, is strikingly shown by the fact that
such preparations as “Neuraline” are now sold without any
restriction whatever. Indeed, as the law at present stands,
the most virulent poisons, if contained in, or sold as patent
medicines, can be obtained by any ordinary person with less
difficulty than the same poisons can be purchased, under
their own proper names, by a medical man. Neuraline, a
patent medicine containing a preparation of aconite, was
brought rather prominently forward, in 1872, in connection
with the death of the Hon. G. C. Vernon, the question arising
as to whether the too frequent use of neuraline by the deceased,
for pains in his head, had been the cause of death.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The phosphoric acid test for aconitia, referred to by Mr.
Montagu Williams during the trial of Dr. Lamson, is described
in Professor Flückiger’s work (“Pharmaceutische Chemie”;
Berlin, 1879); but it is at the same time mentioned that
crystallized aconitia gives only an extremely faint reaction,
and crystallized nitrate of aconitia none at all.</p>

<p>It has been already pointed out (p. 573) that this test is
one which cannot be relied on, and that the violet colour is
believed to be due to impurities present rather than to aconitia
itself.</p>

<p>The internal administration of aconitia in very small doses
is recommended, in cases of dysentery and typhoid fever, by a
writer in the <i>Journal of Medicine and Dosimetric Therapeutics,
according to the method of Dr. Ad. Burggraeve</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
publication edited by Dr. T. L. Phipson. Dr. Burggraeve’s
method (or “dosimetry,” as it is called) is in several respects
similar to homœopathy, and the journal in question cannot be
regarded as a generally accepted authority.</p>

<p>In his speech for the defence, Mr. Montagu Williams
referred to the supposed existence of cadaveric alkaloids or
ptomaines, and to the absence of special chemical tests for
aconitia. With reference to the ptomaines, see Chap. 1, p. 12.
The objection, that there is no characteristic chemical test for
aconitia, is to a great extent deprived of its force when one
remembers that aconitia can be proved to be an alkaloid by its
deportment with the general alkaloidal re-agents; that the
taste test alone will distinguish it from all other alkaloids;
and that it exerts a powerful and distinctive action on small
animals, and ultimately destroys them.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the remark of Lord Coleridge’s,
quoted by Mr. Montagu Williams, is nothing more
than an expression of personal opinion, by an eminent <i>lawyer</i>
on a <i>purely scientific</i> subject; valuable, no doubt, but not
necessarily infallible.</p>

<p>The statement of Messrs. Allen &amp; Hanbury’s assistant,
that aconitia is yellowish-white (p. 544), does not hold good
of all samples: the colour of the alkaloids varies with their
degree of purity, and pure aconitia is not less white than
pure atropia.</p>

<p>Full details of the case of poisoning by aconitia, referred to
by Dr. Stevenson (p. 534), are to be found in <i>Schmidt’s
Jahrbücher der In-und Ausländischen gesammten Medicin</i>,
edited by Dr. Adolf Winter, vol. 189, p. 122: the case was
originally communicated by T. Haakma Tresling to a Dutch
journal (<i>Weekbl. van het Nederl. Tijdschr. voor Geneesk</i>, 16,
1880). The following is a short account of this case.</p>

<p>A patient, for whom medicine containing aconitia nitrate
(to be taken in small and repeated doses) had been prescribed
by a physician, Dr. M., experienced soon after the first and
second doses a burning sensation in the throat, followed by
vomiting and, later on, by difficulty of respiration: the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
was icy cold to the touch, although internally there was a
sensation of burning throughout the body. With the object
of proving that these effects were not attributable to the
medicine, Dr. M., at four p.m. on March 16th, 1880, took a
dose of the mixture, containing rather more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> grain of
aconitia nitrate. The first symptoms of poisoning appeared
in about an hour and a half; and, about four hours after he
had taken the poison, Dr. M. was found to be pallid, with a
cold skin, contracted pupils, small and irregular but not
accelerated pulse, swollen tongue, headache, shivering fits,
and a sensation of burning in the mouth: there was also pain
extending from the throat to the lower part of the stomach.
Suddenly the power of vision became extinct, simultaneously
with a great dilation of the pupils: sight shortly afterwards
returned, the pupils at the same time again contracting.
Vomiting was induced by tickling the throat; the ejected
matter was thick, red-coloured, and contained the remains of
food previously consumed: vomiting subsequently recurred
spontaneously. The first convulsions occurred eight hours
and forty minutes after the dose had been taken; respiration
became more difficult, and Dr. M. complained of humming in
the ears, and deafness, first in one ear and then in the other.
Ether was now subcutaneously injected: dilation of pupils,
with loss of vision, again followed, being succeeded by vomiting,
and violent and long-continued convulsions. In eight
hours and fifty-three minutes extraordinarily violent vomiting
set in, and was followed by a succession of violent convulsions.
Dr. M. could not again be restored to consciousness, the
pupils were dilated and remained unaffected by the light, and
respiration was slow and laborious. Notwithstanding the
employment of electricity, breathing became slower, the beating
of the heart ceased to be audible, and death occurred in
nine hours from the time at which the poison was taken.</p>

<p>On a <i>post-mortem</i> examination being made, it was found
that the surface-tissues of the body were very pale and contained
little blood, while the internal organs were much congested.
The intestinal congestion increased towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
stomach, and diminished towards the large intestine. The
colon, rectum, and bladder were very pale and bloodless. The
latter contained about 70 grammes (= 2¼ fl. oz.) of urine.
The liver and spleen were enlarged, the kidneys small; all
much congested. Defecation had not taken place, though
some urine had been passed. The lungs did not fill the cavity
of the chest; they contained fresh infiltrations and some small
cavities: adhesion, congestion, and, in the lower portions,
numerous emphysematous patches. Much fat was deposited
on the right side of the heart, which contained thin blood.
Brain congested.</p>

Potassio-mercuric iodide, made by dissolving 50 grammes of potassium
iodide and 13·5 grammes of mercuric chloride, in a litre of distilled water.
The reagent is added till no further precipitate is produced, which is known
by filtering a small portion at intervals and testing with the potassio-mercuric
iodide to see if finished. The strength of the solution must be, as nearly as
possible, 1 part of the alkaloid in 200, so that an <i>approximate</i> idea must first be
obtained by weighing or otherwise. As the quantity is in poison cases generally
too small to weigh, the approximate idea must be gathered by comparing the
intensity of the tests with those furnished by known amounts of the alkaloid.
Each cubic centimetre of Mayer’s solution precipitates ·02 gramme of morphia,
·0268 of aconitia, and ·0167 of strychnia. For further details see Blyth’s
Practical Chemistry, 1879, p. 289.</p>

At the inquest, this witness, speaking of the results of the chemical
analysis, said:&mdash;“It may not have been prussic acid, but in conjunction with
some salt nearly allied to it. I do not think it was administered by itself
but in some liquid. The salts of prussic acid have not the same pungent
peculiar odour as prussic acid itself. They would produce death, but he
could not say how quickly.” Mr. Norblad, on the same occasion, suggested
that one of the salts into the composition of which prussic acid enters, might
have been given; “that cyanide of potassium, the salt to which he referred,
would cause death in from two seconds to a quarter of an hour, according to
the amount given.” At the time of the inquest it was not known that the
prisoner had bought of Thomas, Scheele’s solution of prussic acid. On the
properties of the various kinds of these salts, see Mr. Stewart’s remarks,
pp. 73-77.</p>

In giving the examination-in-chief of this witness, I have, through the
kindness of Mr. C. Platt, the clerk of assize of the old Norfolk circuit, been
able to correct the cotemporary reports in the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Bucks Herald</i>by the original report of his experiments made by Mr. Cooper to the prosecution.
Mr. Cooper was unable to be at the inquest, and the results of such
of these experiments as Messrs. Champneys and Norblad had witnessed were
then alone given in evidence, excluding those where the odour of prussic acid
was smelt by Mr. Cooper and his sons, and where the quantity in the portion
of the contents of the stomach submitted to analysation was determined.</p>

The potash and ferrous salt form potassium sulphate and ferrous
hydroxide, the latter combines with cyanogen and more potash to form
potassium ferro-cyanide, the ferric chloride with the potash produces ferric
hydroxide and potassium chloride; when the hydrochloric acid is added, it
dissolves up the excess of ferrous and ferric hydroxides, forming ferrous and
ferric chlorides, and the ferric chloride unites with the potassium ferrocyanide
to form ferric ferrocyanide or Prussian blue.</p>

Professor Carey Lea (American Journal of Science, 3, ix., 121) prefers
to mix a weak solution of ammonio-ferrous sulphate with a little ammonio-ferric
citrate, to acidify with hydrochloric acid, then to place two or three
drops of this on a white plate, and to add a few drops of the suspected solution.
A blue cloudiness indicates HCN. This method, he says, is capable of
detecting <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5000</sub> of a grain of HCN. But I do not think it more delicate than
the old method if properly performed, and it does not so easily admit of comparative
experiment as to quantity.</p>

“From his childhood upward,” says his brother, “no man was gentler of
heart&mdash;his charity was inexhaustible; his kindliness to all who were in distress
well known. To him the wanderer resorted in his afflictions; by him the
poor and houseless were fed and comforted. I write in the face of the public,
with my character as a gentleman and a clergyman at stake, and I avow only
facts that cannot be denied. His liberality was a proverb; his frank sincerity,
his courage, his faithful loyalty to his friends, his temperance, his performance
of the duties of religion, his social relations in the character of
father, husband, and son, won for him the love and confidence of all who
approached him; and though it is true that in one fatal instance he violated
the laws of his country, and subjected himself to a severe penalty for an
infringement of its commercial code, yet, this excepted, his was in all respects
the very opposite of that cool, calculating, cowardly, crafty temper, which is
essential to the poisoner, and we know cannot co-exist with those qualities
which my brother possessed from his earliest years down even to the day
when your lordship sent him to his death.” Letter to Lord Campbell,
pp. 4, 5.</p>

The excuse put forward for this was his wish to raise money for Bate.
The prisoner’s brother complains, in his letter to Lord Campbell, pp. 29, 30,
and with justice, that though the evidence of the negotiation for this insurance
was afterwards excluded as irrelevant, the statement was allowed to be made
by the Attorney-General without a comment, which Lord Campbell must
have known would prejudice the case against the prisoner. This exclusion of
the evidence of a statement which has been allowed to pass unchallenged is
nearly as useless as the formal warning not to pay any attention to some
evidence that has been wrongly admitted&mdash;the prejudice has been raised, and
the mischief already done. But for the result of this trial, he would have
been tried for the murder of his wife, whose body had been exhumed and
analysed.</p>

As the probability of Cook’s state of health predisposing him to epileptic
attacks was made part of the prisoner’s case, the evidence of his regular
medical attendant is subjoined:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Dr. Henry Savage</i>, physician, of 7, Gloucester-place, <i>examined by the
Attorney-General</i>.&mdash;I knew John Parsons Cook. He had been in the habit of
consulting me professionally during the last four years. He was a man not of
robust constitution; but his general health was good. He came to me in
May, 1855, but I saw him about November of the year before, and early in the
spring of 1855. In the spring of 1855 the old affair&mdash;indigestion&mdash;was one
cause of his visiting me, and he had some spots upon his body, about which
he was uneasy. He had also two shallow ulcers on his tongue, which corresponded
with two bad teeth. He said that he had been under a mild
mercurial course, and he imagined that those spots were very syphilitic. I
thought they were not, and I recommended the discontinuance of mercury.
I gave him quinine as a tonic, and an aperient composed of cream of tartar,
magnesia, and sulphur. I never at any time gave him antimony. Under the
treatment which I prescribed the sores gradually disappeared, and they were
quite well by the end of May. I saw him, however, frequently in June, as
he still felt some little anxiety about the accuracy of my opinion. If any
little spot made its appearance he came to me, and I also was anxious on the
subject, as my opinion differed from that of another medical man in London.
Every time he came to me I examined him carefully. There were no
indications of a syphilitic character about the sores, and there was no ulceration
of the throat, but one of the tonsils was slightly enlarged and tender. I
saw him last alive, and carefully examined him, either on the 3rd or 5th of
November. There was in my judgment no venereal taint about him at the
time.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee.</i>&mdash;I do not think that the deceased
was fond of taking mercury before I advised him against it; but he was timid
on the subject of his throat, and was apt to take the advice of anyone. No;
I don’t think that he would take quack medicines. I don’t think he was so
foolish as that.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Mr. Stevens</i>, his stepfather, who saw him at the Euston Station on the 5th of
November, when starting for Rugeley, said, “he looked better than he had
seen him for a long time. ‘You don’t look,’ he said to him, ‘like an
invalid’; and Cook, striking his chest, said he was quite well, and should be
all right if he was happy.” In point of appearance he was not a robust man;
his complexion was pale, and he had sore throat in the previous winter for
some months.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For the defence, <i>Foster</i>, a farmer, said he considered him of a weak constitution,
because he had bilious headaches, the last a year and a half back, but
admitted that he hunted three days a week.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>John Sargeant</i>, a betting man, who met him at the races which he attended,
said:&mdash;I had an opportunity of seeing the state of his throat before he died.
I was with him at the Liverpool meeting the week previous to the Shrewsbury
races; we slept in adjoining rooms. One morning he called me into his room
and drew my attention to his throat, which was much inflamed. There were
ulcers upon it, and the tongue was so swollen, that I said I was surprised at
the state of his mouth. He said he had been in that state for weeks and
months, “And now,” he said, “I don’t take notice of it.” He had shown
me his throat before this at almost every meeting we attended. He took
some gingerbread and cayenne on the platform at Liverpool, and told me
afterwards it nearly killed him. (It came out afterwards that the cayenne nut
was a trick nut.) The witness had also known Palmer supply Cook with
blackwash before his death. He had never seen Cook’s throat dressed by
anybody, and was surprised to see him eat and drink so well. He saw the
blackwash applied (externally) at the Warwick Spring Meeting in 1855.
With reference to another point, this witness spoke to Cook being unable to
pay him more than £10 out of £25 at the Liverpool meeting, and promising
the balance at Shrewsbury.</p>

On the part of the prisoner, a saddler at Rugeley, of the name of <i>Myalt</i>,
whom Fisher spoke of as being in the room with Cook and Palmer, was called
to give an entirely different account of this suspicious incident. “I saw
Cook,” said this witness, “in Palmer’s company on Wednesday, about twelve
o’clock. I had not dined with Palmer, but at my house at Rugeley, and got
back to Shrewsbury between eight and nine, and went to Palmer’s room to
see if he was in. The first person I saw was Cook at the room door, who
said, ‘What brought you here?’ I told him, ‘to see how they were getting
on.’ Palmer, I found, had gone out, and I went into the town, and was
away about an hour. “When I returned Palmer was not there, so I waited in
his room till he returned, about a couple of hours. He came in with Cook,
who was the worse for liquor&mdash;not very drunk&mdash;rather. They asked me to
take some brandy and water; it was produced directly afterwards&mdash;the
brandy in a decanter, the water might be on the table. I did not leave the
room at all, from the time Cook and Palmer came in till they all went to bed.
I did not see anything put into the brandy and water; nothing could be
without my seeing it. Palmer and I left together, and slept that night in the
same room. Cook said something about its being bad. He drank part of it
off, and then gave it to some one to taste. He proposed to have some more,
but Palmer said he would not unless Cook drank his out. Nothing more
happened that night. Next morning Palmer asked me to call Cook. I went
into his room, and he told me how ill he had been in the night, and obliged
to send for a doctor. He asked me what had been put into the brandy and
water, and I told him I did not know of anything. He asked me to send for the
doctor&mdash;Palmer. I did so. The witness did not remember Mrs. Brooks
coming, or Palmer being called out of the room. He swore that Cook did not
say ‘it burns my throat.’ Did not remember Fisher saying that it was no
good his tasting it, as there was nothing in the glass. He told Mr. Gardner and
Mr. Stevens before the inquest what he now said, but they had not subpœnaed
him.</p>

“Lord Campbell did not even read this portion of the witness’s evidence
to the jury. Whatever its value might be, and it had some in the prisoner’s
favour, they were not reminded of it, and can hardly be expected to have
remembered it after a twelve days’ trial.” Letter to Lord Campbell, p. 24.</p>

the <i>post-mortem</i>, was also called to confirm the previous witnesses. He also
proved the extraction of the liver, kidneys, spleen, and some blood, and their
safe delivery through a clerk (Boycott) to the attorneys at Rugeley to Dr.
Taylor for analysis.</p>

Mr. Curling agreed with Dr. Watson, <i>Principles and Practice of Physic</i>,
in the cases of “the sticking of a fish bone in the fauces, the stroke of a
whip-lash under the eye leaving the skin unbroken, the cutting of a corn, the
biting of the finger by a sparrow, the blow of a stick on the neck, the insertion
of a seton, the extraction of a tooth, the injection of a hydrocele, and the
operation of cupping,” but not with “the percussion of the air caused by a
musket-shot.” He also explained that the supposed case of tetanus produced
at once where a negro servant cut his thumb with a dish, rested on the authority
of an old cyclopædia, and that his judgment was more mature and his
experience greater than when, twenty-two years of age, he wrote the treatise
in which he had quoted this case. (It was only in Rees’ Cyclopædia.)</p>

“Mr. Mayhew called on me with another gentleman with an introduction
from Professor Faraday. I received him as I would Professor Faraday, and
entered into conversation with him about these cases. He represented, as I
understood, that he was connected with some insurance company, and wished
for information about a number of cases of poisoning that had occurred during
many years. After we had conversed about an hour, he asked if there was
any objection to the publication of the details. Still believing him to be
connected with an insurance office, I replied that, so far as the correction of
error was concerned, I had no objection to anything appearing. On that
evening he went away without telling me he was connected with the <i>Illustrated
Times</i>, or any other paper. It was not until Thursday that I knew that. It
was the greatest deception that ever was practised on a scientific man.”&mdash;<i>Dr.
Taylor’s evidence.</i> In his charge, Lord Campbell said, “I must say I think
it would have been better if Dr. Taylor, trusting to the credit he had before
acquired, had taken no notice of what had been said; but it is for you to say,
whether, he having been misrepresented, and having written this letter to the
<i>Lancet</i> to set himself right, materially detracted from the credit which would
otherwise be given to his evidence.” It was these statements in the <i>Illustrated

to poison his wife.&mdash;<i>See his case, post.</i></p>

This suggestion of negligence on the part of the operator, Mr. Devonshire,
and the comments on it by the Attorney-General, having subjected him to
several attacks both in the Central Criminal Court and in the <i>papers</i>, he gave
the following explanation in a letter to the <i>Morning News</i>, dated May 29:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“It was agreed in consultation at Mr. Freer’s, at Rugeley, that the stomach
and intestines should be opened, and, with their contents, enclosed in a jar.
It was further agreed that the spinal cord should not be opened if its upper
portion and the brain should prove to be in a healthy condition. At the
examination I was assisted by Mr. Newton, a young gentleman who had, unfortunately,
never witnessed a <i>post-mortem</i>. He punctured the stomach, and
about a teaspoonful of its contents was lost. Afterwards, when Dr. Harland
and I were examining the lining membrane, Mr. Newton suddenly turned the
stomach inside out; an additional half teaspoonful was thus lost, the
remainder falling into the jar. This accounts for Dr. Taylor finding the
mucous membrane in contact with the intestines. With the exception of this
casual puncture I maintain the <i>post-mortem</i> was skilfully performed.”&mdash;<i>Letter
to Lord Campbell.</i> Appendix, p. xxiv.</p>

The extract from Orfila is: “In a dog who for four entire months had
taken no emetic, having taken three grammes in ten days (that is, about forty-five
grains), but had not taken any for four months, the metal was found
accumulated in the bones; the liver also contained a great deal, and the other
tissues but little.”</p>

The letter referred mainly to the case of the prisoner’s wife. Mr. Serjeant
Shee wished only the concluding paragraph to he read, but the Attorney-General
insisted on the whole. It was dated only Jan., published in the
<i>Lancet</i> of February 2, was headed “<i>Audi alteram partem</i>,” and was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have great pleasure in replying to the inquiries in your leading
article of January 19. (1) I stated that I had never known antimonial
powder, when given in medicinal doses (<i>i.e.</i>, from five to eight grains a dose)
to produce vomiting or purging. I am aware that experience differs on this
point&mdash;that some have found the substance inert, and others very active.
From some recent experiments on antimonial preparations, I think it not
unlikely that the powder sometimes contains arseniate of lime. Dr. Pereira
mentions that in the case of a dose of half a teaspoonful it on one occasion
produced violent vomiting, purging, and sweating; while in still larger doses
(120 grains to a dose), prescribed by Dr. Elliotson, it occasioned in some
instances only nausea. I have never met with any case in which serious
symptoms could be referred to its operation; and in the case of Ann Palmer
(the wife) this medical preparation would not account for the antimony found
in her body. (2) My statement as to the cause of death was that the deceased
died from the effects of tartar emetic, and from no other cause; that is the
opinion which Dr. Rees and myself formed from the result of our examination,
and from the description under which the deceased laboured during the eight
days before her death. It is an opinion now equally shared by the two
medical attendants of the deceased. We are quite prepared to maintain this
at the trial.” The letter then went on to describe the state of Ann Palmer’s
body, though not exhumed until eighteen months after death, and contrasted
it with that of the brother, and concluded with the passage given in the text.
Its effect could not be but prejudicial to the prisoner.</p>

In this case, stated by Dr. Christison, the patient had been affected with
some complaint for four weeks, and began to take strychnia; in three hours
there was stupor and loss of speech, and at length violent tetanic convulsions,
and death in three hours and three-quarters.</p>

An instance of the indestructibility of strychnia was communicated by
Mr. F. Crace Calvert, F.C.S., to the London journals subsequently to the
trial. In 1849 several hounds of a pack in Cheshire were poisoned and one
brought to his laboratory, from which, by the usual process, strychnia was
obtained. “As the master of the hounds attached great importance to the
case, he requested me,” writes Mr. Calvert, “to obtain a sufficient amount of
poison from the stomachs of some other of the dead dogs, that I might not
only be convinced of the presence of the poison, but might also bring some of
the extracted strychnia into court. To enable me to do so, several dogs were
disinterred and brought to my laboratory, and the space of time from the
date of death to that when I submitted them to analysis was at least three
weeks, and I still perfectly succeeded in extracting strychnia from their
stomachs and exhibiting it in the state of crystallised hydrochlorate.”&mdash;<i>Appendix
to Letter to Lord Campbell</i>, p. xxix. Another correspondent to the
<i>Times</i> called attention to the practice in Mexico of killing a worn-out mule
with <i>nux vomica</i>, leaving its carcase to be eaten by the wolves, which are thus
killed, and that the Turkey buzzards who feed on the dead wolves also die of
the poison.&mdash;<i>Ib.</i> p. xxv.</p>

The table of cases of poisoning by strychnia, with their symptoms and
results of the <i>post-mortem</i>, given by Mr. Woodman and Dr. Tidy, shows that
the state of the heart varies. In six cases it was contracted and empty, in
some others the right side only was empty, and in one both sides were filled
with blood.&mdash;<i>Handy Book of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology.</i> London.

In a letter to the <i>Times</i> of June 4, Mr. Herapath says: “I learnt on my
return here (Bristol) that Mr. Yates had visited Bristol with an anonymous
letter in his hand (since acknowledged to have been written by the magistrates’
clerk, Keynsham), and questioned several gentlemen whom I am in the habit
of meeting, as to whether they heard me say ‘that I had no doubt strychnia
was in Cook’s body, but that Dr. Taylor could not find it,’ and ‘that a word
from me would hang the man.’ They all said they had heard me speak of the
case, but not in such terms. The mayor said that ‘he could not say the
exact terms, but the impression on his mind was, that I thought strychnia
was there, but that Dr. Taylor could not find it.’”&mdash;<i>Letter to Lord Campbell</i>,
Appendix, p. xxxi.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a></span>
“The controversy,” as to the non-discovery of strychnia by Dr. Taylor,
says Mr. Justice Stephen, “was foreign to the merits of the case, inasmuch as
the evidence given for the prisoner tended to prove, not that there was no
strychnia in Cook’s body, but that Dr. Taylor ought to have found it if it was
there. In other words it was relevant, not so much to the guilt or innocence
of the prisoner, as to whether Mr. Herapath and Dr. Nunneley were better
analytical chemists than Dr. Taylor. The evidence could not be even considered
relevant to the shaking of Dr. Taylor’s credit, for no part of the case
rested on his evidence except the discovery of the antimony, as to which he
was corroborated by Mr. Brande, and not contradicted by the prisoner’s
witnesses.” (One does not see how this could have been accomplished, as
they were not present at the analysis.) “His opinion as to the nature of
Cook’s symptoms was shared by many other medical witnesses of the highest
eminence, whose credit was altogether unimpeached. The prisoner’s counsel
was placed in a curious difficulty by this state of the question. They had to
attack, and did attack Dr. Taylor’s credit vigorously, for the purpose of rebutting
his conclusion that Cook might have been poisoned by strychnia:
yet they had to maintain his credit as a skilful analyst. For if they
destroyed it, the fact that he did not discover strychnia went for nothing.
This dilemma was fatal. To admit his skill was to admit their client’s guilt;
to deny it, was to destroy the value of nearly all their own evidence. The
only possible way was to admit his skill and deny his good faith; but this
too was useless for the reason just assigned.”&mdash;<i>History of Criminal Law in
England.</i> Vol. III., 418.</p>

Roberts, Theory and Practice of Medicine, 1877, Vol. II., 23, gives the
following symptoms of angina pectoris:&mdash;“Abrupt suddenness&mdash;intense
præcordial pain&mdash;oppression and constriction of the chest&mdash;suffocation, no
cyanosis&mdash;tenderness of chest rare&mdash;face pale, sweat&mdash;expression of intense
anxiety&mdash;pulse mostly feeble, flickering occasionally&mdash;vomiting and eructation.
Conscious at first, but, if prolonged, may be syncope. Spasmodic
movements, and even general convulsions may be observed. Usually several
brief paroxysms with intermissions. Tendency to rave under slight exciting
causes.” Dr. Bristow, Theory and Practice of Medicine, agrees with this,
and adds, “After death various lesions&mdash;most important <i>the calcification of
the coronary vessels</i>&mdash;fatty and other degenerations of the muscular tissue of
the heart. In other cases the heart perfectly healthy.”</p>

In <i>cross-examination</i>, after admitting that he attested the proposal to the
<i>Prince of Wales</i> office for £13,000 on Walter Palmer’s life, and saying that
he did not recollect attesting another proposal on the same life to the
<i>Universal</i>, the proposal to that office was put into his hand, and he was
asked if the “Jeremiah Smith” attesting it was his signature. “It is very
like my signature,” he said, “but I have a doubt of it.” (After a pause) “I
believe it is not my handwriting; I swear it is not. I think it a very good
imitation. I did not receive the document from Pratt; I might from W.
Palmer. I don’t recollect.” (After some hesitation) “No doubt he did give
it to me. I got it before it was signed.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Do you now say it is not your signature?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I do.” (He then admitted getting appointed agent to the
Midland County office in order to get a policy for £10,000 on Bate’s life.)</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“I will refresh your memory with regard to these proposals.
Look at that, and tell me whether it is your handwriting?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Now, refreshing your memory with that document,
were you applied to in December, 1854, to attest a proposal of Walter Palmer
to the <i>Solicitors’ and General</i> office for £13,000?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“That is my signature, certainly.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General</i> repeats the question.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I don’t recollect.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“What, with your signature staring you in the face?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I might have been a witness to it. I am speaking from
memory.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Have you any doubt, after looking at that document?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“I have no doubt.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“At last we have got at it from you. Now look to that
document, and see if another month afterwards&mdash;in January, 1855&mdash;you were
asked to attest another proposal for £13,000 to the <i>Prince of Wales</i> office?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness</i> (hesitating).&mdash;“That is my signature. (A pause.) Perhaps if I
saw the paper I could answer.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“There is the paper.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness</i> (after a pause).&mdash;“I might have signed it in blank. I have some
doubt whether I did not sign some of these in blank. The body of the papers
is in the handwriting of William Palmer.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Upon your oath, don’t you believe that William
Palmer applied to you to attest the proposal on his brother’s life for
£13,000?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“He did apply to me.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Attorney-General.</i>&mdash;“Was it not to attest the proposal for £13,000 on his
brother’s life?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Witness.</i>&mdash;“One of them was for £13,000. I don’t think I was present
when Walter Palmer signed the assignment. I believe Jeremiah Smith’s
(another witness of that name) handwriting is very like mine.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">After much fencing with the question, the witness saying he might or he
might not have attested Walter Palmer’s signature to a deed of assignment,
the <i>Attorney-General</i> put a cheque for £5 into the witness’s hand, and asked
him if it was William Palmer’s signature to it.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“It is.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Question.</i>&mdash;“Did you take that piece of paper to the bank and get £5 for
it, and that for attesting the signature of Walter Palmer to the deed of
assignment?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“I may have got the £5 at the bank; but upon my honour I do
not know what for. (Laughter.) Cook, with reference to the £200 bill,
gave Palmer £10 for the accommodation, and he took the money to Shrewsbury
races. I cannot say who saw me on the Monday night when I went up
to Cook’s room at the ‘Talbot Arms.’ I did not notice. I believe that
either the chambermaid, the waitress, or the cook saw me go into the hotel.
I don’t know who drove the fly to Stafford.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">This witness was also severely cross-examined as to his relations with
Mrs. Palmer, replying with the same caution as to their impropriety, and
could not get further than “that there ought not to be any truth” in the
imputation.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mr. Justice Stephen, who was present at the trial, gives the following
graphic sketch of the demeanour of this witness:&mdash;“No abbreviation can
give the effect of this cross-examination. The witness’s efforts to gain time,
and his distress as the various answers were extorted from him by degrees,
may be faintly traced in the report. His face was covered with sweat, and
the papers put into his hands shook and rattled.”&mdash;<i>Hist. Criminal Law of
England.</i> Vol. III., p. 399, note. “And yet, after all,” as the learned
judge adds, “he was right as to the time according to the inspector at Euston.
If Smith spoke the truth, Newton could not have seen Palmer at all that
night, and Mills, if at all, must have seen him in Smith’s company. Mills
never mentioned Smith” (and was never asked by the defence if he came with
Palmer), “and Smith would not swear that she or anyone else had seen him
at the ‘Talbot’ that night.”</p>

Smith (not Jeremiah, subsequently examined, pp. 185-6), when called for
the defence, said that he sent the soup to Cook by Rowley, but not to Palmer’s
on the way.</p>

Palmer’s brother, in the letter to Lord Campbell, states that Sanders,
the trainer, if called (who had been examined before the coroner), could have
proved that Cook excused his not giving him more than £10 when he came
to see him, on the plea “<i>that he had given all his money to Palmer to take
with him to London to settle his affairs</i>,” and that he was in court at the trial,
and when not called by the prosecution, was sent out of the way to prevent his
being called for the defence.&mdash;<i>Letter to Lord Campbell</i>, pp. 18, 19.</p>
<p class="pfc4">He was called on his subpœna at the close of the evidence for the defence
(tenth day), and when he did not answer, the Attorney-General said, “I
should be deeply grieved if it could be possibly thought that the absence of
any witness could in any way prejudice the prisoner’s case, and if my learned
friend makes any application on that ground it shall not be resisted by me.”
<i>No application was made.</i></p>

It was an acknowledgment that certain bills, of which the dates and
amounts were set out, were all for Cook’s benefit, and signed either J.P. or
I.P. Cook. Cheshire was under Palmer’s influence, and a few days after
opened Dr. Taylor’s letter to Mr. Gardner with the account of the results of
the analytical examination, and disclosed them to Palmer, for which he was
prosecuted and punished.</p>

Whilst Palmer was in Stafford jail, inquests were held on the bodies of
his wife and his brother Walter. In the first case there was no manner of
doubt that she had been gradually dosed to death by antimony. In that of
the brother, the analysis failed to detect any poison, a fact probably
accounted for by the length of time that had elapsed since the death and the
action of the lead coffin, if prussic acid was the poison used. In both cases,
however, verdicts of wilful murder against Palmer were returned. On the
21st of January Palmer was brought up from jail as a witness in an action on
one of the £2000 bills purported to be signed by his mother, the signature of
which was denied by her; clerks in banks and others who knew her handwriting
well also agreeing that it was a forgery. At last Palmer was produced
in custody. He entered in a perfectly cool and collected manner, nodded
familiarly to his friends in the crowded court, and gave the following evidence
in a low, yet firm and distinct voice, without a sign of trepidation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Mr. Edwin James</i> (putting the disputed bill into his hand).&mdash;“Is the signature
of William Palmer, as drawer of this bill, in your handwriting?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Palmer.</i>&mdash;“Yes.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Mr. James.</i>&mdash;“And did you apply to Mr. Padwick to advance you money
on it?”</p>

On this point, which was also put very strongly by Lord Campbell in his
charge, the prisoner’s brother, in his letter to that judge, accuses the prosecution
of cunningly keeping back a witness of the name of Cockayne, who had
been examined before the coroner and whose deposition was before the Court,
who would have explained the use for which the strychnia was bought.
“Had he been, as he ought to have been called, he would have proved that
he kept a gun loaded in the stable, by order of my brother, to shoot the dogs
that worried his brood mares, and that he also threatened to poison them,
and that the strychnia was purchased for that object, and that he had missed
dogs since then, which had been in the habit of prowling about the pastures
and hunting the mares.” He also accounts for the non-production of
poisoned dogs, by the “medical fact that they go away to die in secret, concealed
and quiet places, where they die undiscovered, and would be mortally
attacked in so short a time that they could not get to their own home.” He
further accuses them of sending this witness, and Sanders the trainer, who
would have proved that Cook told him he had given Palmer all his money,
out of the way, so that the prisoner’s solicitor could not call them for the
defence.&mdash;<i>Letter to Lord Campbell</i>, pp. 17, 19. But see <i>ante</i>, p. 188, note.</p>

The prisoner’s brother, on the contrary, says that he distinctly, in a most
solemn interview, declared his “perfect guiltlessness of blood.” The same
writer unfortunately lessens the value of his other statements by a coarse
attack on Lord Campbell as a worthy successor of Jeffries, and imputes to
him and Baron Alderson a deliberate intention to force the jury to a conviction.
As I had not the advantage of being present at the trial, I can only
say nothing of this appears in any of the reports of the trial which I have
collated, and whilst on the contrary we now have the evidence of an experienced
criminal lawyer, who saw and heard all. Still, however, remains
the great difficulty that strychnia, as every analytical chemist will testify,
ought to have been found, if it had been given, though the failure to discover
it does not conclusively negative the probability of it having been administered.
Dr. Guy has suggested that morphia might have been the cause,
introduced into the pills, a point of which would seem to be made in Serjeant
Shee’s speech, and which would account for Palmer’s statement that Cook
was not killed by strychnia, and with his wish for a further examination of
the body by Mr. Herapath.&mdash;<i>Hist. of Crim. Law of England.</i> Vol. III.,

that she was seized in her limbs and could not stand, neither could she take
anything. I went to Mr. Morley, and I am sure I did not expect to see her
alive when I came back; but thank God she was alive, and that was all; she
was entirely prostrated. Mother has been to see her. If you would like to
see her you had better come by London for three and sixpence. Harriet
would like to see her, but she thinks of the expense. My dear wife’s love to

death, without mentioning her name, and Mr. Morley also related the results
of the analytical examination of her body in conjunction with Mr. Nunneley,
who was called on behalf of Palmer, and maintained that if it had been given,
strychnia must have been found by analysis six days after death (pp. 124-8).</p>

“The suggestion of Dr. Williams,” says Judge Stephen, “that Dove had
allowed his mind to dwell on his wife’s death till at last he became the victim
of an uncontrollable propensity to kill her, if correct, would not prove that
his act was not voluntary. It is setting and keeping the mind in motion
towards an object plainly conceived that constitutes the mental part of an
act. Every act becomes irrevocable before it is consummated. If a man, for
example, strikes another, he may repent while his arm is falling; but there is
a point at which he can no more deprive his arm of the impetus with which
he has animated it, than he can divert from its course a bullet which has been
fired from a rifle. Suppose he deals with his mind in this manner at an
earlier stage of the proceeding, and so fills himself with a passionate, intense
longing for the forbidden object or result, that he becomes, as it were, a mere
machine in his own hands. Is not the case precisely similar, and does not the
action continue to be voluntary and wilful, although the act of volition which
made it irrevocable preceded its completion by a longer interval than usual?</p>
<p class="pfc4">“It must, however, be remembered, that the proof that Dove’s propensity
was uncontrollable was very defective. An uncontrollable propensity, which
accidental difficulties or the fear of detection constantly control and divert for
a time, is an inconceivable state of mind. Is there the smallest reason to
suppose that, if Mrs. Dove had met with a fatal accident, and had been lying
in bed dying before her husband gave her any poison, his uncontrollable
propensity to kill her would have induced him to give her poison nevertheless?
If not, the propensity was like any other wicked feeling. It was certainly
uncontrolled, and it may probably have been strong, but that is
different to uncontrollable.”&mdash;<i>History of the Criminal Law of England</i>, by
Mr. Justice Stephen. Vol. III., p. 435-6.</p>

Baron Bramwell especially called attention to the letter of the prisoner
to his mother of the 25th of February, describing his wife’s first attack (see

replying about his nativity, to “write in milk, or lemon, or anything else
that would not show till put to the fire.”</p>

That would be February the 23rd, when Fisher’s mother come to Dove’s

In his comments on this extraordinary case, Mr. Justice Stephen&mdash;after
noting Dove’s predisposition to madness in his infancy; the fact that the
symptoms of the disease exhibited themselves at frequent intervals, yet never
reached such a pitch as to induce his friends to treat him as a madman;
the prurience with which he dwelt on the prospect of his wife’s death; the
forming of the design of putting her to death, and the deliberate contrivance
and precaution with which he carried it out&mdash;says:&mdash;“In this state of things
can he be said to have known, in the wider sense of the words, that his act
was wrong? He obviously knew that it was wrong in the sense that people
generally consider it so; but was he capable of thinking, like an ordinary man,
of the reasons why murder is wrong, and of applying these reasons to his
conduct? There was evidence both ways. His irrationality, however, was
occasional, and he appears to have acted rationally enough as a rule, and to
have transacted all the common affairs of life. Did, then, this act belong to
the rational or irrational part of his conduct? Every circumstance connected
with it referred it to the former. It was a continued series of deliberate and
repeated attempts, fully completed at last.”&mdash;<i>History of the Criminal Law.</i>

letters much time was occupied. In his charge the Lord Justice Clark
said, that “though the procedure adopted had been loose and slovenly, it did
not appear that the panel had suffered any prejudice from the want of any of
them. As to each letter being in its proper envelope, in the first part of the
correspondence, it did not much signify whether such were the case; because
there was no doubt that those passionate letters written by the prisoner,
declaring such strong love for L’Angelier, and some of them expressed in very
licentious terms, were written by her at some time or other.”</p>

Referring to the evidence of Dr. Penny, the Dean, in his speech for the

the Crown is very defective, to say the least of it. They knew very well
when they were examining the contents of this poor man’s stomach, and his
intestines generally, what was the arsenic that the prisoner had bought.
They knew from her own candid statement that she bought it partly at
<i>Murdoch’s</i> and partly at <i>Currie’s</i>. If that arsenic had been swallowed by the
deceased, the colouring-matter could have been detected in the stomach&mdash;there
was one means of connecting the prisoner with this poison which was
found in L’Angelier’s stomach, and a very obvious means. It may be very
well for Professor Penny and Dr. Christison to say now that their attention
was not directed to this matter. Whose fault was this?&mdash;the whole thing
was in the hand of the authorities. They kept it to themselves&mdash;they dealt

As proof that L’Angelier’s first illness could not have been on the night
of the 19th and morning of the 20th, the Dean referred to the fact that “on
the 21st he ordered of his butcher the largest piece of beef to be found in his
pass-book (7lbs.), and had fresh herrings in such a quantity as to alarm his
landlady, and a still more alarming quantity and variety of vegetables.”
“There’s a dinner for a sick person!” He also said, “I give my learned
friend the option of being impaled on one of the horns of the dilemma&mdash;I care
not which. He was ill from arsenical poisoning on the morning of the 20th,
or he was not. If he was, he received arsenic from other hands than the
prisoner’s. If he was not, the foundation of the case was shaken.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_114_114" id="Footnote_114_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a></span>
“What is the evidence of Mrs. Jenkins on this point? She says he was
in his usual condition on the 21st, when he made that celebrated dinner, and
she thought he was making himself ill, and on that 21st he told her he should
not leave the house all the following day&mdash;the Sunday. He had, therefore,
I maintain, no appointment to keep, else he would never have made that
statement. On the 22nd Mrs. Jenkins says she had no recollection of his
going out. When he did go out at night, and came in late, what was his
habit? Mrs. Jenkins says he never got into the house on those occasions
except in one of two ways&mdash;either he asked her for a check key, and got one,
or Thuau opened the door for him. He did not ask for a key that night, and
Thuau says he certainly did not let him in.”&mdash;<i>Speech of the Dean of Faculty
for the defence.</i></p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_115_115" id="Footnote_115_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a></span>
To the evidence for these statements, the Dean of Faculty objected that,
though the guard of the train from Stirling was shown the photograph of
L’Angelier, and identified him by it, the photo. was not shown to Ross&mdash;that
Ross only spoke of him as a foreigner&mdash;that no one at the place where he
had refreshments at Coatbridge was called to identify him&mdash;that the
“foreigner” told Ross he had walked from Alloa (eight miles), and not from
the Bridge of Allan, and that on the Friday or Saturday previous he had
walked into Stirling to try and get a cheque cashed, and yet no attempt was
made to show that he did so. The witnesses for the defence, on the contrary
(Adams, Kirk, Dickson, druggists), were clear (Adams) that at half-past five
on Sunday, the 22nd, a gentleman came to his shop for 25 drops of
laudanum; Dickson, of Batherton, two miles from Coatbridge, that one whom
he recognised as extremely like the photo. of L’Angelier came for a similar
dose at 6.30 on a Sunday at the end of March, suffering from a bowel complaint;
and Miss Kirk, of the Gallowgate, Glasgow, who remembered a
gentleman, “as like as anything I ever saw” to the photo. of L’Angelier,
came about 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on a Sunday night at the end of March for a medicine, and
got a white powder. [But it must be remarked that, weak as this evidence
was, it was weakened by the admission of Adams that his customer did not
complain of illness&mdash;by that of Dickson that it might have been in April,
and by the inability of Miss Kirk to fix any date for the occurrence, or to
state what the powder was, though she identified the purse from which the
party took the money for the payment of it.]</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_116_116" id="Footnote_116_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a></span>
On the question whether this letter brought L’Angelier to Glasgow, the
Dean referred to an expression in one of his letters to Thuau, that he did not
know what “Mr. Mitchell could want with him,” and inferred that it might
be to hear about this person that he hurried up to Glasgow and called on
M’Alister, who probably might have given some information on this point
had he been called. [If so, why was he not called for the defence?]</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_117_117" id="Footnote_117_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a></span>
“I have already shown,” said the Dean, “how constantly she repeated
to him her warning that on no account he was to make the slightest noise of
any kind. Therefore, without previous arrangement, it does not appear to
me possible for these parties to have met on the occasion on which the
prosecutor says they did. If I am right in reading that letter, she expected
him on Saturday evening, and she waited and waited, as she had upon
Thursday, but he did not come. On the Sunday evening she did not expect
him. Why should she? When he did not come on Thursday evening, when
he did not come on Saturday evening, why should she expect him on the
following evening? Well, then, that is the state in which her expectations
were on that occasion, and her conduct precisely squares with it. She is at
home in the family. They are all at prayers at nine o’clock. The servants
come up to attend prayers with the family. Mackenzie, the suitor of Haggart,
remains below while the family are at prayers. The servants afterwards go
down stairs to bed, as usual&mdash;one after the other. The family then retire to
rest, and the prisoner, with her youngest sister, goes to her bedroom about
half-past ten or eleven. They both get into bed about the same time; and,
so far as human knowledge can go, that house is undisturbed and unapproached
till the prisoner is lying in the morning side by side with her
sister, as she had fallen asleep. The watchman was on his beat&mdash;he knew
L’Angelier well&mdash;and he saw nothing.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_118_118" id="Footnote_118_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_118_118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a></span>
Regarding this third charge in the light of probabilities, the Dean said:&mdash;“If
you believe the evidence of the Crown, he suspected the prisoner of
having tried to poison him. But my learned friend says his suspicions were
then lulled&mdash;she had become more kind to him before he left town. I
thought my learned friend said he was brooding over it when in Edinburgh,
and spoke of it in a serious tone to the Towerses. That was on the 16th of
March, after which date he had nothing to change his mind in the shape of
kindness from the prisoner, and therefore if he did once entertain the suspicion,
however unfounded, there was nothing to remove it from his mind
anterior to the 22nd of March. A man, whose suspicions are excited against
a particular person, is not very likely to take poison at that person’s hand;
and yet, what are we asked to believe that he took from her hand that
night? That he took from her hand a poisoned cup, in which there lurked
such a quantity of arsenic as was sufficient to leave in his stomach after death
82 grains; such a dose indicating the administration of at least double&mdash;aye,
I think Dr. Christison said the administration of at least half an ounce (240
grains)&mdash;and that he took it that evening from the hand of the prisoner, with
all his previous suspicions that she was practising on him. It is a dose
which, as far as experience goes, was never successfully administered by a
murderer. There is not a case on record in which it has ever been shown that
a person administering poison to another ever succeeded in persuading him to
swallow such a quantity.” [But note as to confidence after suspicion, that of
Cook in Palmer, after the suspicious illness at Shrewsbury.&mdash;See Palmer’s
Case, <i>ante</i>; and as to quantity administered by murderers, note <i>ante</i>,
p. 319, and Appendix B., p. 358.]</p>

<i>Christina Haggart</i>, if she was to be believed, appears to contradict this
assertion. On <i>re-examination</i> she said that between a month and two before
her apprehension Miss Smith asked her to leave the back gate into the lane
open after ten at night, and stay in the kitchen a little, as she was to see her
friend. When she did so she saw no one in the lane, but as she went into the
kitchen, which was in front of the house, she met Miss Smith going towards
the back door. She heard footsteps coming through the gate&mdash;that she
stayed in the kitchen till she heard Miss Smith go to her own room. She
stayed about half an hour. “<i>Charlotte Maclean</i>, the cook, stayed in the kitchen
with me at my request.” In this she was confirmed by Maclean, but she could
not say she heard Miss Smith in the passage, though she heard her afterwards go
to her bedroom. Miss Smith’s statement to Dr. Meau is true, if the meeting
took place only at the back gate. The Lord Justice Clerk, however, spoke of
this evidence as proving that L’Angelier was in the house in Blythswood Square.</p>

In a letter with post-mark September 18, 1855, she alludes to some such
threat, “Beloved, you are young, you ought to desire life.” In another with
post-mark October 19, 1855, she writes, “‘Before long,’ you say, ‘I shall
rid you and all the world of my presence.’ God forbid that you should do this.”
“This,” said the Judge, “was a common enough mode of influencing females;
and if such was his design, he seemed to have succeeded.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a></span>
As to the evidence for the defence, that L’Angelier had on one occasion
threatened to throw himself out of the window at the “Rainbow” Tavern,
his lordship observed, “As the witness was in bed at the time the deceased
had ample opportunity to have thrown himself over, if he had been so inclined,
before the witness could interfere; and the jury would consider
whether, when going about the room in that excited state, he had only thrown
open the window to get air. As to the other stories that he would drown
himself, if jilted, they did not amount to much, as on one occasion he had
been jilted, and had not drowned himself. You will consider whether all
this is merely the vapouring of a loose, talkative man, fond of awakening an
interest in the minds of others about himself, or whether it affords any
indication that he was likely to commit suicide. As to the evidence about
giving arsenic to horses in France, which would be useless unless given constantly,
he did not see its importance. If he was in the habit of taking it in
small quantities, he knew its qualities, and therefore this did not aid the
notion that he took an immense quantity on the 22nd to destroy himself.
No doubt the prisoner was not bound to prove that he poisoned himself, but
it was a hazardous thing to set up a defence that L’Angelier went out that
night carrying such a quantity of arsenic in his pocket, and that he swallowed
it, how, when, and where, no human being could conceive.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_122_122" id="Footnote_122_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122_122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a></span>
“It is very difficult,” said the learned Judge, “to say what the
exasperated feelings of a female placed in such a situation as this woman was
might not lead her to do. And here it is that the correspondence becomes
of the utmost importance, as shewing what feelings she cherished about that
time, what state and disposition of mind she was in, and whether there was
any trace of moral sense or propriety to be found in her letters, or whether
they did not exhibit such a degree of ill-regulated, disordered, distempered,
and licentious feelings, as shew that the writer was quite capable of compassing
any end by which she could avoid exposure and disgrace, and of
cherishing any feeling of revenge which such treatment might excite in her
mind, driven nearly to madness by the thought of what might follow the
revelation of this correspondence. We have heard a good deal said by the
Dean of Faculty as to the character of this person: we have no evidence on
the subject, except what these letters exhibit, and no witness to character is
brought; and certainly these letters exhibit as extraordinary a frame of mind
and of passion as perhaps ever appeared in a court of justice. Can you be
surprised, that after such letters as those of the 29th April and 3rd May
(inviting him in very plain terms to meet her for that purpose at the garden
gate of the country house), that on the 6th May, three days afterwards, he
got possession of her person? On the 7th she again writes, and in that letter
is there the slightest appearance of grief, of repentance, of remorse? It is the
letter of a girl rejoicing in what had passed, and alluding to it particularly in
terms which I will not read, for perhaps they were never previously committed
to paper, as having passed between man and woman. There could be
no doubt of the state of degraded and unholy feeling into which she had
sunk, probably not the less so if it was produced by his undermining and
corruption.”</p>

If this was the use for which the prisoner bought the arsenic, it is at
least curious that she did not buy it until the 21st of February, 1857, when
she was endeavouring to get her letters back from L’Angelier. The article in
<i>Blackwood</i> was in December, 1853. <i>Johnston’s</i> Book was published in 1855,
and of the papers in <i>Chambers</i>, the first was in December, 1851, the second in
June, 1853, and the third in July, 1856.</p>

Without wishing to fight over again the case of <i>Eliza Fenning</i>, I would
refer any one at all curious on this point to a letter to the <i>Times</i>, quoted in
the “Annual Register” for July 29, 1855, from the Rev. J. H. Gurney, the
nephew of the well-known shorthand writer, in which it is stated, on the
authority of an extract from his uncle’s note-book, that <i>Eliza Fenning</i> did
confess the crime to the Rev. James Upton, a Baptist minister, whose chapel
she attended, though she subsequently maintained her innocence to other
visitors.</p>

The learned Judge had previously said, “If this had been an appointment
about business, and it had been shown that a person came to town for
the purpose of seeing another, and he went out for that purpose, having no
other object in coming to Glasgow, they would probably scout the notion of a
person saying, ‘I never saw or heard of him that day that he came;’ but the
inference they were asked to draw was this, that they met on that night,
when the fact of their meeting is the foundation of the charge of murder.
Therefore the jury must feel that the grounds of drawing an inference in the
ordinary matters of civil business, or the actual appointment of mutual
friends is one thing, and the inference from the fact that he came to Glasgow,
that they did meet, and that, therefore, the poison was administered to him
by her at that time, is another, and a most enormous jump in the category of
inferences.”</p>

<i>A. Andrews</i> also proved that she had only objected to the <i>post-mortem</i>
because she knew the deceased objected to it; that she said “Thank God,

<i>James Urry</i>, the secretary of the benefit society, proved that the deceased

In this case, which was tried before the late Lord Denman, at the
Summer Assizes, 1848, very many of the guests at a dinner given to celebrate
the election of an Independent minister were seriously affected, and the
death of the chairman (an invalid) hastened, by eating of a blancmange made
in the form of a cucumber, surrounded with leaves&mdash;all of the natural green
colour. In colouring this sweet, emerald green, in which, on analysis, 47½
per cent. of arsenite of copper was found, had been used to such an extent
that the colour was in some parts half an inch in depth. The pastrycook
(Franklin) had been previously warned, by the chemist who sold it to him,
of its poisonous qualities, and for a time had discontinued its use for eatables;
and the defence was, that in this case his apprentice (Randall) had used it
under the impression that the sweet was only for ornament. They were both
found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment
with hard labour.</p>

According to the <i>Apotheker Zeitung</i>, No. 14, April 3, 1879, out of 118
samples of children’s toys officially examined in 1878, 53, or nearly one-half,

were punished. As to dresses, see Chem. News, v. 114.</p>

In the case of <i>Maria Gage</i>, tried at the Summer Assizes, at Ipswich, on
the 2nd of August, 1851, for the murder of her husband, it was proved that
she had got a neighbour to purchase for her a pennyworth of stuff for rats and
mice, which was found to consist of linseed with arsenic enough to kill half
a dozen men.</p>

“Considerable sensation has been excited by the report that arsenic had
been detected in the paper collars, &amp;c., manufactured by a Leipzig firm. On
a careful examination, conducted by six of the most eminent chemists, the
accusation was proved to be utterly unfounded.”&mdash;<i>Chemiker Zeitung</i>, No. 45,
1879.</p>

In this case, which was tried in April, 1835, before Sir Charles Wetherell,
as Recorder of Bristol, a widow lady of the name of Mary Smith, who had
lodged with the prisoner, was poisoned by her, in October, 1833, for the sake
of the money and other property she had with her. The accused was proved
to have purchased yellow arsenic about six days before Mrs. Smith’s death,
and to have been seen putting some yellow powder out of a paper from her
pocket into a basin of gruel, after taking which Mrs. Smith was seized with
dreadful convulsions, and died. In consequence of suspicions created by the
prisoner’s subsequent conduct and false statements, a <i>post-mortem</i> was held of
the body, exhumed fourteen months after death. The report of this examination
was very striking. “A thick, yellow coating, like paint, lay on the mucous
membrane of the stomach, particularly over the pyloric third, but it extended
more or less with some small interjections of unstained membrane to within
two or three inches of the great cul-de-sac.” The accused was convicted and
executed.</p>

“A curious toxicological case is reported from Hamburg. The body of a
man who died in 1867 was taken for examination. It was thought necessary
to determine arsenic, not merely in the corpse in question, but in the soil of
the churchyard at different distances from the coffin, and also in the body of
another man who had been subsequently buried in the same grave. This
latter body was perfectly free from arsenic, which, however, was found in the
first corpse in ample fatal quantity (3·6 grains), whilst in the lid of the
coffin and in the adjacent ground very minute quantities were traced. Hence
the conclusion was fairly drawn that the man in question had been poisoned
with arsenic, and that a portion of the poison had been gradually transferred
from his body to the wood of the coffin and the adjacent soil.”&mdash;<i>Chemiker
Zeitung</i>, No. 7, February 13th, 1879.</p>

When we bear in mind how small a space even 200 grains of arsenic
would occupy&mdash;not more than that of an ordinary seidlitz powder&mdash;the suggestion
of L’Angelier carrying this means of suicide about him, when keeping
the supposed appointment on the Sunday night, is by no means improbable.
And when his evident tendency to attempt self-destruction, when irritated or
depresssed, is remembered, it is within the range of probability, that, if either
the meeting took place and ended with a quarrel, or he failed to obtain a
meeting, in the excited state of mind which either circumstance would have
created, he in desperation swallowed the drug very shortly before he returned
to his lodgings, only to die. This is a far more probable suggestion than that
set up by the defence, that he had been dosing himself with arsenic on the
road from Stirling to Glasgow. The difficulty is that purchases of arsenic by
L’Angelier could not be proved. But, looking to the careless way in which it
was exposed in the shops of some of the firms with which he had relations
(evidence of <i>Fleming</i> and <i>Townsend</i>), he might have got it from thence, without
its being known, or he might have purchased it in Edinburgh on his visit
there, where he could not be easily recognised. He certainly had an unwholesome
hankering after this drug.&mdash;G. L. B.</p>

According to <i>Mary Patterson</i>, Mrs. Taylor was in the kitchen about
7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, as well as usual, only appearing a little peevish in consequence of her
night-watching. <i>Mary McLeod</i> met her going up stairs from the consulting-room

in her daughter’s bedroom asking for hot water to make her vomit, when she

In a letter to his father-in-law on the 3rd of March, Pritchard wrote:
“I am very much fatigued with being up with dear Mary Jane, who was very
much worse yesterday, and passed a wretched night. Wednesday has been a
periodic day with her during this illness, and she always dreads it. Her
prostration is extreme, and her appetite quite failed. <i>Dr. Paterson has
recommended Dublin stout and some very simple medicine.</i>”&mdash;<i>Evidence of Mr.

On Dr. Paterson’s evident feeling against the prisoner, the Lord Justice
Clerk made the following remarks: “It is said that he exhibited a strong
feeling against the prisoner; no human being could feel otherwise if he had
formed the impression that Mrs. Pritchard was being poisoned in the hands
of her husband, her medical attendant. It is said that he exhibited this
feeling in a marked unpleasant manner in the box. That is a matter of
manner, and, if the feeling existed, I do not know that he could have made
his evidence really more valuable if he had concealed the existence of it. It
may be an unpleasant thing to see what is called an <i>animus</i> in a witness
exhibited in the witness-box. If he has a feeling strong upon him, and that
on good ground, he may come into the box and entirely suppress all appearance
of it, because he has more command of his feeling, or a better
manner of concealing it. The fact remains, that if he takes up the position I
have described, he cannot, as a man of ordinary feeling, feel otherwise than
unfavourably prepossessed against the prisoner.” Again, on his concealment of
his suspicions, the Judge said: “Now, he thought it consistent with his professional
duty&mdash;and I must also add with his duty as a citizen of this country&mdash;to
keep this opinion to himself. In that I cannot say he did right. I
should be very sorry to lead you to think so. I care not for professional
etiquette, or professional rule. There is a rule of life and a consideration far
higher than these&mdash;the duty that every citizen of this country, that every
right-minded man owes to his neighbour&mdash;to prevent the destruction of
human life in this world, and in that duty I cannot but say that Dr. Paterson
has failed. Now you will consider what effect that is to have, or whether it
is to have any effect on your minds. It is a very painful subject&mdash;a subject
which I would fain avoid, but the exigencies of this case drive me to its consideration&mdash;and
I am bound to say that, because a man is so mistaken in
regard to his duty to his fellow-citizens, and his fellow-creatures, it by no
means follows that he is undeserving of credit as a witness. You may con
sider his evidence always in the light of that failing; if you can see reason to
modify anything that he says, because of the existence of that failing, it is
your bounden duty to do that.”&mdash;<i>Charge of the Lord Justice Clerk.</i> Fifth
day.</p>

In reply to the Judge, the witness said that to take 7 grains of Fleming’s
tincture Mrs. Taylor must have taken 100 drops of the poisoned Battley in a
single dose, equal to a teaspoonful; that 100 drops would not be an unusual
amount to a person accustomed to the use of it in moderation, and that
many opium eaters would not thank you for 100 drops. Aconite might be
given in divided doses, and not prove fatal, though the same quantity was
taken, the distressing effect of one dose going off before the other was taken.</p>

<i>Dr. Gairdner</i> stated that the only time he saw Mrs. Pritchard was on the

her until the 11th of February, “to the best of his recollection, stopped all

<i>Dr. Paterson</i> stated that he was called on the 24th of February to see
Mrs. Taylor, and then noticed the state in which Mrs. Pritchard was, but not
being asked did not prescribe for her. He was called in to Mrs. Pritchard
first on the 2nd of March, when he prescribed powders containing camomile,
blue or gray powder, ipecacuanha, and aromatic powder, and he never saw her
again until five hours before her death. There is not a word in his evidence
of his having been previously consulted about the use of Battley’s solution.
The only interviews with the prisoner, other than in the sick-room, were on
the 1st of March, when he met him in the street and he asked him to see his
wife, and on the 5th of March, when Pritchard called on him, reported that
the remedies had had a good effect, and Dr. Paterson recommended their
continuance.</p>

“Mr. Clark very properly said,” remarked the Judge in this charge, “‘it

relation that gave him these opportunities.’ Quite true, gentlemen&mdash;a very

did in point of fact exist, he cannot argue the case as if they did not.”</p>

“His possession of poisonous drugs,” said the Judge in his charge, “to
such an extent is not a suspicious circumstance in the case of a medical man.
They are in some degree necessary; but the peculiar position of the matter in
this case&mdash;the nature of the drugs found in his consulting-room&mdash;is certainly
not to be lightly passed over, and still more the nature of the purchases that
he had been making from two different apothecaries during the period to
which our inquiries particularly refer. In his consulting-room were found
some parcels of tartaric acid&mdash;not a very large quantity; some phials, containing
the remains of tincture of aconite and white powder to the extent of
three or four grains, containing a somewhat strange and unexplained mixture
of tartarised antimony or tartar emetic and aconite. These things were found
in his consulting-room; but what had he been purchasing during the period
to which our inquiry refers? On the 16th of November he purchased an
ounce of tartar emetic, and upon the 7th of February another ounce of the
same poison&mdash;very unusual quantities, as the apothecaries state. He also
purchased no less than 5½ ounces of tincture of aconite. That, the apothecaries
state, is a very unusual quantity for a medical man to purchase: but I
think it was a mistake in some respects to push this statement to the extent
to which the prosecutor pressed it, because some of the other witnesses of the
same description said that for external application tincture of aconite is sometimes
used in considerable quantities, and if it were used for that purpose we
might account for such a large quantity being used by the prisoner. But I
do not think anybody said, that two ounces of tartar emetic within a month
or two was a usual quantity for one medical man to use who was not in the
practice of mixing it at home, which the prisoner, in his conversation with
Dr. Paterson, says he was not. Besides, there were other very strange purchases,
which have no immediate connection with this case&mdash;all of them
strong poisons. He was, therefore, undoubtedly possessed of a very large
quantity of different kinds of poisonous substances; but what is most important
is, that he was in possession of that very poison to which the death
of Mrs. Pritchard is undoubtedly to be traced, and to which, in combination
with others, the death of Mrs. Taylor is to be traced&mdash;that is antimony. So
that whether we adopt to the full extent the suggestion of the Crown, it
appears beyond a doubt that some one had been practising a system of poisoning,
and that in the possession of the prisoner were the agents necessary for
carrying it on.”</p>

“It is said,” remarked the Lord Justice Clerk, “that it would be very
difficult that cheese could be poisoned by antimony&mdash;very difficult to make a
powder like tartar emetic adhere to a piece of cheese in sufficient quantity to
have any effect, and that, if it did, it must have been visible to the naked
eye, because the cheese was yellow and the tartar emetic was white. But we
know from the evidence before us that tartar emetic is easily dissolved, and
the poisoned cheese could easily have been poisoned by dipping it into a
solution, quite as easily as by dipping it into a powder.” <i>See Chapter IX.</i></p>

On this argument of the prisoner’s counsel the Lord Justice Clerk said:&mdash;“It
is difficult to offer an answer to that. It is impossible to say what is the
precise point to which a poison of this kind will kill&mdash;what is the precise
amount that will at once destroy life as compared with that which will only
inflict suffering and torture. But that Patterson did suffer these severe
vomitings and pains immediately after having tasted the egg-flip I suppose
you will not disbelieve, looking to the general character of the evidence which
she gave here as a witness.”</p>

With reference to the finding of the bottle of Battley’s solution the Lord
Justice Clerk made the following remarks:&mdash;“To that scene I beg now to call
your attention as given by Mary Patterson. ‘When the bottle was found,’
she says, ‘he expressed great surprise that she should have taken so much of
its contents in so short a time.’ Now he was quite aware, as you will see by
the evidence, that the old lady was in the habit of taking a great quantity,
and you will consider whether the surprise was real or feigned. That is but a
very small point, however, in reference to this matter. His expression in regard
to it, seemed to me much more strong. He expressed surprise at her having
sent ‘a girl like that for it’&mdash;namely, McLeod. I cannot see that there is
anything so startling in that. Did he mean to suggest that in sending such a
messenger there might be some mistake as to the contents of the bottle?
Why, what was it, ‘to send a girl like that?’ What was the harm of
sending a girl&mdash;an intelligent servant girl? What was wanted was Battley’s
solution, because it was what Mrs. Taylor wanted&mdash;was accustomed to take.
But still he thought that it was a very serious matter&mdash;and further, that it
was one of those things that it would not do to have spoken of as having
occurred in his house&mdash;a man of his profession.”</p>

The prisoner called on the solicitor on the Saturday and asked him to
come up the next day to draw the will, to which he consented on the prisoner’s
representation of the state of the lady&mdash;but wished a medical man to
be present. The prisoner, however, assured him it was quite unnecessary, as
she was suffering only from diarrhœa, and was quite in her right mind. “I
went,” said the witness, “to the prisoner’s lodging, and he informed me that
they were not married, which was another reason why he did not wish a
medical man to be present. I then went up to the bedroom of the deceased,
and the prisoner said to her, ‘My dear, this is the gentleman who has come
to make your will.’ She bowed, and handed me the paper which I had seen
on Saturday. I looked at it, and asked her if that was what she wished, and
read it to her, and she said it was quite correct, except that she wished to
leave a brooch to a friend. I then drew up the will in accordance with her
instructions, in a lower room. The prisoner was with me, and, when the will
had been drawn up, said the daughter of the landlady could be one of the
witnesses, and he supposed I could say it was some Chancery paper. I told
him that would not do. She must know it was a will, and he replied, ‘Oh,
very well.’ Shortly afterwards the deceased executed the will, and I and
Miss Wheatley attested it, and I handed the document to the prisoner, who
paid me my fee. She appeared perfectly competent to make a will.”&mdash;<i>Evidence

opposition, after his punishment for bigamy.</p>

From the sudden and serious illness of one of the jurors, however, the
examination of the witnesses had to be suspended, and the trial adjourned to
the first day of the next Session. Eventually he was put on his trial, before
another jury, on the 15th of August. As the statement of Serjeant Ballantine
was fully confirmed by the witnesses, the landladies of the respective lodgings,
and the sister, it will be necessary only to report the medical evidence.</p>

It must be borne in mind that there was no error in this experiment, and
that it was never suggested that the arsenic in this case came from the copper,
as it was not destroyed, as when the bottle of chlorate of potash was afterwards
tested with copper gauze, which was destroyed by it, and the arsenic
in the gauze liberated. Serjeant Parry, of course, said that the experiments
in both cases were the same. So they were so far as copper was used, but the
presence of the chlorate of potash in the other case made all the difference.&mdash;<i>See</i>
Chapter IX.</p>

Had this discovery of arsenic not been erroneous, the gap in the evidence,
as to the possession of the poison by the prisoner in a form most likely to
be administered, would have been filled up. It in no way, however, militated
against the discovery of arsenic in bottle 2. See <i>post</i>, Chap. IX., how far
Mr. Herapath was correct in asserting that more arsenic was found than could
have been released from the copper. In his statement before the committing
magistrates, on the 20th of May, Serjeant Ballantine stated that bottle 21 had
originally been sent by Dr. Julius with a quinine mixture.</p>

Subsequent to the verdict, in a memorial to the Prince Consort, it was
stated that “a lady friend of the deceased was a witness,” to Miss Bankes’
knowledge, of the fact that he was married already, and that she wished the
ceremony to be gone through. This lady, the memorial stated, was to have
been called, but Mr. Parry deemed it unnecessary. Upon this, the Lord
Chief Baron, in his report to the Home Secretary, observed&mdash;“I do not
believe Mr. Serjeant Parry gave any such advice; but if it be true that any
such evidence was ready, why is not the lady friend named, and why is not
her statement or declaration now offered and laid before you? Such evidence
would, in my opinion, much alter the complexion of the case.”&mdash;<i>Judge
Stephen’s Hist. of Crim, Law</i>, iii., 461. [What need was there of this
evidence, when it had been proved that for weeks together Miss Bankes had
been lodging and associating in the same house with Smethurst and his
wife?]</p>

When <i>Dr. Julius</i> was recalled, and stated that at the first examination
before the magistrates the prisoner urged that it was necessary for him to go
back to his wife; that her death might be occasioned by his absence; and
that it was imperative that he should go; Serjeant Parry asked the witness
“whether the magistrates at that time did not direct or require him not to
interfere further with the patient?” To this he replied&mdash;“I do not think it
was addressed to him, but it was addressed generally&mdash;it was in his presence.
It might have been a general direction, but he might have heard it.”</p>

the bedside, and two cups on the table. I took the cup
from the chair by the bedside down stairs, and ate the sago, which did me no
harm.”[As the prisoner said he took it in about 5 a.m., the sago, being in
an open cup, could not have been <i>warm</i> at 8·30. It was also clear, from
other parts of her evidence, that she was in favour of the prisoner, and
anxious to throw the crime on the Cafferatas.</p>

“An attempt,” says Mr. Justice Stephen, “was made to account for the
presence of antimony and arsenic alleged to be discovered by Dr. Taylor, by
the suggestion that it might have been contained in the medicines administered
to Miss Bankes during her life. Arsenic is generally found in
bismuth, and for three or four days doses of bismuth, containing five or six
grains, were administered to Miss Bankes. Dr. Richardson put the proportion
of arsenic in bismuth at half a grain to an ounce, and as an ounce contains
480 grains, each dose would have contained about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>140</sub> of a grain of
arsenic. If, therefore, Miss Bankes took twelve doses of bismuth, she would
have taken between one-eleventh and one-twelfth of a grain of arsenic in four
days. This seems (for it is not perfectly clear), from Dr. Bird’s evidence, to
have been more than a week before the day on which he obtained the evacuation
analysed by Dr. Taylor, and in 4 oz. of which he said he found nearly a
quarter of a grain.”&mdash;<i>History of Criminal Law of England</i>, Vol. III., 459.</p>

The following is a list of the various articles delivered to Dr. Stevenson
for analysis:&mdash;“I received a number of bottles and things from Mr. Bond.
There was a bottle, duly secured and sealed, and labelled ‘liver, spleen, and
kidneys.’ That was labelled with the letter A. I received a bottle labelled
‘B,’ containing parts of small intestines, cæcum and colon, and other parts
of the intestines handed to Dr. Bond on December 7. A third bottle was
received, containing part of the stomach. The fourth was a bottle secured,
sealed, and labelled ‘stomach,’ handed to Dr. Dupré by Mr. Bond on December
7th, ‘D.’ The fifth was a bottle, sealed and secured as before, ‘urine,’
handed to Dr. Dupré by Mr. Bond on December 7, ‘E.’ The sixth was a
bottle, sealed and labelled ‘vomit;’ and on another label, handed to Dr.
Bond by Dr. Berry, December 6, ‘F.’ With this was a broken bottle, unlabelled,
and a gutta-percha wrapper, with two seals upon it, as Mr. Griffin
said. The next, ‘7,’ was a pill-box. It was secured and sealed, and marked
on the tape which secured it ‘C.B.’ That is the pill-box (identified), and it
is sealed in the same manner as the wrapper of the broken bottle. ‘8’ was
a newspaper parcel sealed; ‘9’ was a brown paper parcel sealed; ‘10’ was a
paper parcel sealed. That was the whole of what I received from Mr. Bond.
‘11’ I received from Inspector Butcher. That was opened in the presence of
Mr. Bond. It contained a box&mdash;(this is the box)&mdash;with capsules in it. These
capsules in the bottle were some of the 107 capsules. There was a paper with
some sugar in it; some loose sugar, sweetmeat sugar. It contained a box of
quinine powders&mdash;(box identified)&mdash;labelled ‘quinine powders’ in writing,
and had the name ‘J. W. Littlefield, Ventnor,’ in print. There were four
pills loose, one large comfit from a Dundee cake, and one of the capsules contained
what appeared to be a pill, but which was really a similar comfit.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“I don’t think you said what was in the newspaper parcel?”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Eight packets.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“What did the next parcel contain?”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Nine packets. Packet 11 I received from Inspector Butcher on December
12, marked ‘1 W. D.’ Inside that there were two little tinfoil packages.
Twelve was received from Butcher on December 14. It was a parcel labelled
‘The remainder of the sugar from Dr. Bedbrook’s.’ Sherry from the decanter
used by Lamson was handed to me by Butcher on the 14th.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Did you later on receive this box and wafers?”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Yes. It is marked 14.”</p>

of a ticket having been issued for luggage on the 29th August, in the name of
“Lamson,” which Mr. Poland proposed the porter (John Durrant) should
use to refresh his memory. As the witness could not identify the prisoner

Mr. Montagu Williams admitted, in his speech, that the prisoner visited

on the 2nd that the witness went with him, the first time, to Wimbledon. In
his affidavit in support of the plea of insanity J. L. Tulloch says, that “he
saw Dr. Lamson at his brother’s (W. Tulloch) for a few minutes on the 1st,

In the boy’s box, on the ground floor, five pills mixed with capsules
were found. Twenty white powders, which were numbered 1 to 20, were got
from a box in the dining-room, marked “J. Littlefield,” six of which&mdash;1 to.
6&mdash;were large. The tin box with the two pills was handed to the police
inspector by Mr. Bedbrook, and a decanter of sherry from the sitting-room,
and the remainder of the sugar from the matron. The evidence of <i>Inspector
Fuller</i>, and other policemen, proved that after being transferred from various

The fact of this poison having been sold by Allen &amp; Hanbury’s
assistant to the prisoner, on the faith of finding his name in the <i>Medical
Directory</i>, was severely commented on by the Judge. No doubt by 31 Vict.
cap. 121, sec. 17, Schedule A. Amendment Act, 32 &amp; 33 Vict. cap. 117,
sec. 3, it is not required, in the case of a medical man, that the name of the
purchaser, the name and quantity of poison sold, and the purpose for which
it is to be used, should be entered, and the signature of the purchaser is not
required. The following questions and answers call for publication:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“Suppose I applied and gave a name out of the Medical
Directory, and asked for two grains of aconitia, would you sell it me?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“If I were satisfied at the time you were a medical man I should
let you have it.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“Then anybody of respectable appearance and well dressed
might apply? and is there anything by which you can satisfy yourself that
the applicant is not an impostor and telling you that which is not true?”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The only thing would be the style of writing&mdash;whether it was
in the style characteristic of medical men.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“That hardly seems satisfactory.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Mr. Poland.</i>&mdash;“The Act does not require registration in the case of sale to
a medical man.”</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>The Judge.</i>&mdash;“It strikes me that anyone could go, if he had sufficient
knowledge to write in the technical style of medical men, and get poison
without difficulty; and though the matter is not before us in this case, it may
be that the law requires amendment in this particular.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The jury also appended to their verdict a presentment urging greater
restrictions on the sale of poisons, with which the Judge thoroughly agreed,
and undertook to forward it to the Home Secretary. During the present
Session of Parliament the Government have announced that a “New Poisons
Act” is preparing, and that it will deal with patent medicines. It is
imperatively required.</p>

daily for two months.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_220_220" id="Footnote_220_220"></a><a href="#FNanchor_220_220"><span class="label">[220]</span></a></span>
Mrs. McElroy, when, with Lamson’s consent, taking charge of his medicines,
found among other things an unmarked box of “sugar pills,” which
Lamson said were either morphia or quinine, he did not know which. On
this evidence the following remark is made on the accused’s behalf:&mdash;“After
he (Lamson) left, and when John was taken ill, several pills were discovered
on the table, which were not noticed while Lamson was there. It is believed
that as John was suffering from indigestion (he had dined at one, and portions
of his dinner were vomited undigested at nine) he determined to take a pill,
and try with it one of the capsules just given him. John’s symptoms of
poisoning did not begin till about three-quarters of an hour (<i>really twenty-five
minutes</i>, see p. 520) after Lamson left, and he lived for about four hours
after, whereas if he had taken the poison in the capsule, while Lamson was
there, it is almost certain that the symptoms would have set in much earlier,
especially considering the enormous quantity of poison said to have been
taken. He then, unhappily, selected one containing aconitia. From the
foregoing evidence of the way in which Lamson used and prescribed aconitia,
taken with what Mrs. McElroy says of his ignorance as to what his own
medicaments contained, it might well be that he ignorantly or insanely
mixed these pills, and sent them to Percy John without any murderous
intent.”</p>

A sample of “English aconitine,” recently obtained from Morson’s, was
amorphous, slightly coloured, and gave a red-brown colour, with all acids,
even acetic; yet its physiological action was perfect.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_222_222" id="Footnote_222_222"></a><a href="#FNanchor_222_222"><span class="label">[222]</span></a></span>
In “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan” (Isabella L. Bird, 1880), it is stated
that the Ainos, an interesting race inhabiting a part of that country, poison
their arrow-heads with a paste prepared from the root of a species of aconite,
Aconitum Japonicum.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_223_223" id="Footnote_223_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_223_223"><span class="label">[223]</span></a></span>
A servant girl was recently poisoned in New York by repeatedly rubbing
tincture of aconite on the gums to relieve pain. She died in three days.
(British Medical Journal, Aug. 26, 1882.)</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_224_224" id="Footnote_224_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_224_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a></span>
Woodman and Tidy, p. 393, wrongly give this as “one ounce of the
tincture.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_225_225" id="Footnote_225_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_225_225"><span class="label">[225]</span></a></span>
The case of Reg. <i>v.</i> McConkey, already referred to (<i>ante</i>, p. 515), furnishes
us with an instance of aconite root being administered with criminal
intent, and with fatal result.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Aug., 1882, four boys and a girl suffered severely from chewing dried
aconite root, which they had found in the street. The symptoms, tingling
and numbness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, muscular weakness,
pains in the legs, and coldness of the feet, set in very rapidly, the
greatest delay being a quarter of an hour. There was no dyspnœa, and the
pupils in all were <i>widely dilated</i>. The treatment adopted was the administration
of emetics (sulphate of zinc and vin. ipecac.), coffee and brandy, and
castor oil. Recovery in two to seven days. Quantity taken, “a very small
piece.” (Brit. Med. Journal, 1882, p. 1039.)</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_226_226" id="Footnote_226_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_226_226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a></span>
An illustration of the dangerous character of these preparations, and
of the serious results which may ensue from the mistake of a person ignorant
of medicine, is afforded by the following case, reported in the <i>Medical Times
and Gazette</i>, of January 22, 1853. An inquest was held on January 15th,
1853, to inquire into the death of Emma Forty, an inmate of the Roman
Catholic Convent of the Good Shepherd at Arnosvale, near Bristol. The
deceased suffered from tapeworm, for which the medical attendant of the
convent had prescribed a decoction of pomegranate bark and quinine.
According to the general custom at the convent, the medicine was prepared
by Miss Ryder, the sister-attendant, who unfortunately took a wrong bottle
from the dispensary, and gave, instead of the decoction, <i>a drachm of
Fleming’s Tincture of Aconite</i>. This mixture was given to the deceased on
the Monday preceding the inquest (Jan. 10th); and death occurred in about
five hours after the draught had been swallowed. After some remarks by
the Coroner as to the imminent danger of unskilled persons being allowed to
dispense drugs, the jury returned a verdict that death was occasioned by
the administration of aconite by Miss Ryder, and expressed the opinion that
much blame was attributable to the authorities of the convent for allowing
persons, without the necessary knowledge, to dispense medicines: they
hoped that in future such a practice would be discontinued.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_227_227" id="Footnote_227_227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_227_227"><span class="label">[227]</span></a></span>
A report of the inquest is to be found in the Pharmaceutical Journal,
1872, p. 618. The deceased was the Hon. Gowran Charles Vernon, Recorder
of Lincoln, and second son of Lord Lyvedon. According to the evidence
of a brother of Mr. Vernon, the latter had for some time past complained of
pains in his head, and had been in the habit of using neuraline with the
object of relieving these pains. On returning to his residence, after a walk
with his wife, the deceased was seized with a fit, and shortly afterwards died.
The doctors considered that he was suffering from neuralgia and epileptic
fits. Mr. G. Harley, M.D., M.R.C.S., stated that he had analysed neuraline,
and found it to be an extract of aconite, mixed with rose-water; it also contained
chloroform. The Coroner (Dr. Lankester) said there was no doubt
that the deceased had expired from natural causes, and that he had been
seized with a fit of convulsions, from the effects of which he died.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
